# Oldham Market Research & Page Plan for Renegade Solar

## 1. The Oldham Opportunity

### Why Oldham Makes Sense

- **Proximity**: Only 9 miles / 13 minutes' drive from Prestwich. Closer than many areas already served (e.g. Altrincham, Stockport, Bramhall, Marple).
- **No current coverage**: Renegade has zero Oldham pages. The only nearby overlap is a Failsworth solar page (Failsworth is technically in the Oldham borough). There's a gap to fill.
- **Large borough**: Oldham Metropolitan Borough has ~96,000 households. It's a whole borough with multiple distinct towns and neighbourhoods, each worth targeting.
- **Housing stock dominated by terraces**: 48.8% of property sales are terraced houses — the highest proportion in Greater Manchester. These are bread-and-butter solar installations that Renegade already handles well.
- **Affordable property = cost-conscious homeowners**: Average terraced house price is £168,080 (30% below UK average). These homeowners feel energy bills more acutely and are prime candidates for solar savings.
- **Strong council backing for green energy**: Oldham declared a Climate Emergency in 2019 and became the UK's first "Green New Deal Council" in 2020. They secured £20m Levelling Up funding for green initiatives. The council runs Oldham Community Power (solar on schools) and approved a £1.35m solar farm at Wrigley Head. This creates a local culture receptive to solar.
- **Government grants available**: ECO4 and Local Authority Flex schemes offer grants to households with EPC ratings D-G or low income — many of Oldham's older terraced properties will qualify.
- **0% VAT on domestic solar**: Until 2027, no VAT on residential solar and battery installations.

### Oldham Neighbourhoods Worth Targeting

## 4. Proposed New Pages

### Location Root Page
- `src/locations/oldham.md` — Main Oldham landing page (layout: location-root.html)

### Service + Location Pages
- `src/services/solar-and-battery-installations/oldham.md` — Residential solar in Oldham
- `src/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/oldham.md` — EV chargers in Oldham
- `src/services/electrical-safety-inspections-eicr/oldham.md` — EICR inspections in Oldham
- `src/services/commercial-solar-installations/oldham.md` — Commercial solar in Oldham

### Potential Neighbourhood Pages (Phase 2)
Once the main Oldham pages are established, consider adding location root pages for:
- `src/locations/chadderton.md`
- `src/locations/royton.md`
- `src/locations/shaw.md`
- `src/locations/lees.md`
- `src/locations/saddleworth.md`

Each of these could then have their own service sub-pages. Saddleworth in particular is worth targeting early — higher property values, larger roofs, more energy consumption, and homeowners more likely to invest in solar.

### Content Strategy Notes

- The Failsworth solar page already exists and is strong. The new Oldham pages should reference the Failsworth work as proof of local activity.
- Oldham pages should emphasise terraced house expertise since that's the dominant property type.
- Saddleworth pages should take a different angle — larger detached homes, higher energy usage, bigger systems, premium positioning.
- Conservation area guidance is relevant — several areas in Saddleworth and central Oldham have restrictions.
- The council's Green New Deal and community solar initiatives create a natural hook for content.
- ECO4 grants are particularly relevant for Oldham's lower-income areas.

## 5. Questions to Ask About Solar Installs in Oldham

These questions will help gather first-hand knowledge to create authentic, detailed content for the Oldham pages. The answers will differentiate the content from generic competitor pages.

### Your Experience in the Oldham Area

1. Have you done any installations in Oldham borough (beyond Failsworth)? If so, where — Chadderton, Royton, Shaw, Lees, Saddleworth, central Oldham? What were the properties like?

2. What's your experience with the typical Victorian terraced houses you find in Oldham — the old Accrington red-brick mill worker terraces? Do they present any particular challenges for solar (roof condition, access, shading from neighbouring chimneys)?

3. Have you worked on any properties in the Saddleworth villages (Uppermill, Greenfield, Delph, Dobcross, Diggle)? These are quite different from central Oldham — stone-built, rural, potentially conservation area. Any experience or thoughts?

4. Failsworth is technically part of the Oldham borough. You've done work there — are there specific photos or stories from those jobs we could reference on the new Oldham pages to show you're already active in the area?

5. Have you had any enquiries from Oldham that didn't convert? If so, what were the common reasons? Price comparison with other local installers? Property suitability issues?

### Property Types & Technical Considerations

6. Oldham has the highest proportion of terraced houses in Greater Manchester (nearly 49% of sales). For a typical 2-bed or 3-bed terrace in places like Chadderton or Royton, what size system would you typically recommend? How many panels can you realistically fit?

7. Many Oldham terraces have the roof running parallel to the street, meaning east-west facing slopes rather than south-facing. How much does this affect output in practice? Do you ever recommend panels on both east and west slopes?

8. Chimney stacks on terraced houses can cause shading issues. How do you handle this — panel-level optimisers, micro-inverters, or just positioning around the shading? Are there terraces where it's genuinely not worth doing?

9. Oldham sits on higher ground than Manchester (some areas are 200m+ above sea level). Does the elevation, wind exposure, or weather pattern make any practical difference to installations or panel performance?

10. A lot of the older terraced stock in Oldham has stone slate roofs rather than modern tiles. Does this affect installation — different fixings, weight considerations, any specialist requirements?

11. Some Oldham properties still have older electrical systems — old fuse boxes, no RCD protection. How often do you encounter this, and what's the typical additional cost for a consumer unit upgrade alongside a solar install?

12. For the larger detached homes in Saddleworth, what size systems are you typically recommending? 6kW? 8kW? More? What kind of savings can these homeowners expect?

### Battery Storage & EV Specific to Oldham

13. For Oldham's terraced houses with lower energy consumption, does a battery still make financial sense, or would you sometimes recommend panels only? What's the threshold where you'd say a battery isn't worth it?

14. Many Oldham terraces have no driveway — just street parking or a rear yard. How does this affect EV charger installations? Do you run cables through to rear yards? What about charging from a front-mounted charger when you park on the street?

15. For commuters from Oldham into Manchester (common route — 20-30 minute drive or Metrolink tram), what kind of daily charging costs would a typical EV use? How does this compare to petrol for the same commute?

### Commercial & Landlord Market

16. Oldham has a significant landlord/buy-to-let market, particularly in central areas. Do landlords enquire about solar? Is there a business case for a landlord to install solar on a rental property, or does it only make sense if they're paying the electricity bill?

17. Oldham town centre still has old mill buildings and commercial/industrial units. Have you done any solar installs on these types of properties? What are the opportunities and challenges?

18. Are there types of commercial businesses in Oldham where solar would be a particularly good fit — takeaways, corner shops, small manufacturing, warehouses?

### Pricing & Competition

19. How does your pricing compare to the competitors active in Oldham? Greentech Renewables in Bury advertise 0% finance — do you offer anything similar, or do you compete on price/quality/service?

20. E-Verve Energy advertises solar in Greater Manchester "from £3,395." Is that realistic for a decent system, or is it a loss-leader / minimal spec quote? What would a typical Renegade installation cost for an Oldham terrace?

21. Trust Renewables position themselves as a social enterprise. Does that angle resonate with customers, or do people ultimately choose on price and reviews?

22. Some competitors offer in-roof (integrated) solar panels. Do you offer these? Are they popular for terraced houses where aesthetics matter?

23. Logic Renewables are based right in the Oldham area (Shaw/Royton). Do you see them as your main local competitor? Any thoughts on how to differentiate?

### Grants, Schemes & Local Knowledge

24. Oldham Council has active ECO4 and Local Authority Flex schemes offering grants for energy improvements. Have any of your customers used these? How does the process work — does the homeowner apply separately, or can you help facilitate?

25. Are you aware of the Oldham Green New Deal initiatives — the community solar schemes, the Wrigley Head solar farm, the Energy Futures project? Could any of this be referenced in the content to show alignment with the council's direction?

26. Oldham Community Power has put solar on local schools. Have you ever done any public sector or community installations? Would you be interested in this kind of work?

27. For Oldham properties in conservation areas (parts of Saddleworth, some central Oldham areas), what are the practical limitations for solar? Do you ever recommend standalone battery systems for properties where roof panels aren't possible?

### Content & Marketing

28. What would you say to an Oldham homeowner who's on the fence about solar — maybe they think Manchester doesn't get enough sun, or that their terraced house is too small?

29. Is there anything specific about Oldham properties or the local area that you'd want highlighted on the website — something that national companies wouldn't know or bother mentioning?

30. If a customer in Chadderton or Royton calls you, how quickly could you typically get out there for a survey? Same day? Next day? Within the week?

31. Do you have any existing Oldham-area customers who might provide testimonials or case studies we could use (with their permission)?

32. Are there any particular panel brands or battery systems you'd recommend specifically for Oldham's terraced houses — maybe something compact or particularly efficient for limited roof space?

33. For Saddleworth specifically — these are often premium properties with higher energy bills. Would you pitch the service differently here compared to, say, a 2-bed terrace in central Oldham?

34. The Metrolink tram runs through Oldham (Shaw, Derker, Oldham Mumps, Oldham King Street, Freehold, South Chadderton, Hollinwood). Is there any angle around EV chargers and public transport — e.g., people who drive to a tram stop and park?

35. What's the single strongest reason someone in Oldham should choose Renegade over a competitor who's already based in the area?
