## Technical Claims and Statistics

Regarding solar performance, the DMEGC Infinity RT series achieves 23.8 percent efficiency. The website states that solar panels work from daylight, not just direct sunshine, so they perform well in cloudy Manchester conditions. N-type TOPCon technology performs better than older P-type panels in low light and cloudy conditions, and panels generate well even in overcast Northern England weather.

Regarding battery economics, the website states that off-peak electricity prices can be as little as one-third of peak rates. Battery systems work with smart tariffs like Octopus Go.

Regarding commercial solar, the website mentions specific case studies. One is a Prestwich baker facing £10,000 per month in electricity bills. Another is a Bolton carpet warehouse spending £700 per month, where a 50-panel flat roof design would reduce bills to zero with a 3-year payback. A second option for that warehouse involves a 115-panel system covering both flat and pitched roofs, with a 4-year payback. The website states that commercial installations can reduce bills by 70 to 100 percent, and systems have an expected life of over 20 years.

Regarding EICR statistics, the website cites that 70 percent of electrical fires happen in buildings built before 1950, and that 1 in 5 new builds have electrical faults. For landlords, EICR inspections are a legal requirement every 5 years and for new tenants. Penalties for non-compliance can reach fines of up to £30,000.

## Installation Process

For residential solar and battery installations, the process has six steps. First is a free survey and consultation to assess the property and energy usage. Second is design and planning, which produces a tailored quote for the home and energy needs. Third is installation, which is completed professionally with minimal disruption, typically taking 1 to 2 days. Fourth is commissioning, where the system is tested to safety and regulatory standards. Fifth is smart setup, where the system is configured for optimal performance with the chosen tariff. Sixth is aftercare, with 2 years of routine maintenance included.

Regarding DNO and grid connection, the company handles all paperwork including building control notifications and DNO applications. They also set up Smart Export Guarantee arrangements so customers can sell excess electricity back to the grid.

---

## Key Differentiators

The company emphasises several differentiators. First is personal service, with Ashley handling every aspect personally from survey through to installation. Second is that the company is not tied to a single manufacturer, so they can recommend the best solution for specific circumstances. Third is an honest approach, stating they will advise against solar if the numbers don't work for the customer. Fourth is being a local business based in Prestwich, which means quick response times and no call-out charges for surveys. Fifth is that all certifications are government-backed, including MCS, TrustMark, and NAPIT.
