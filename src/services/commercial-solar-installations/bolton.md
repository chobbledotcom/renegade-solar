# Commercial Solar for Bolton Businesses

We're currently designing a system for a carpet and interior design warehouse in Bolton - they spend £700 monthly on electricity. Our 50-panel flat roof design brings that to zero with three-year payback. After that, it's decades of free electricity and income from selling excess back to the grid. If your Bolton business faces similar costs, [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/) could transform your bottom line.

Commercial properties benefit more from solar than domestic ones because businesses consume electricity during the day when solar generation is at its peak. Unlike [domestic installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) where evening consumption requires [battery storage](/services/home-battery-installations/), commercial properties use energy as it's generated. This means you're using nearly every kilowatt-hour your panels produce, which dramatically improves the financial returns.

## Bolton businesses that see the best returns

Bolton has numerous retail units, carpet shops, furniture stores, and warehouses with large flat or pitched roofs going unused. These properties are perfect for solar installations that generate substantial daytime energy exactly when businesses need it. Retail and warehousing operations with high daytime electricity consumption see excellent returns because they're using the power as it's produced.

Bolton's industrial heritage means many factories and manufacturing facilities with heavy machinery consumption still operate across the area. High electricity usage from production equipment means faster payback periods - often 3-4 years for commercial installations. Food businesses including cafes, bakeries, and restaurants with commercial kitchens and refrigeration also benefit enormously. We recently spoke to a [Prestwich](/services/commercial-solar-installations/prestwich/) baker spending £10,000 monthly who nearly went under because of rising electricity costs.

Hotels and hospitality businesses running kitchens, heating, and facilities throughout the day benefit from solar's rapid payback and long-term savings. Bolton's commercial properties often have extensive roof space that's currently generating zero value - we can turn that into decades of cost savings.

## Real numbers from our Bolton client

This family-owned warehouse bought their building in the 1980s and now spends £700 monthly on electricity. They've got a massive flat roof that's perfect for solar. We designed two options: 50+ panels covering just the flat roof brings their bills to zero with three-year payback, or 115 panels covering both flat and pitched roofs with four-year payback and maximum generation. Both options eliminate electricity costs and provide 20+ years of free energy after payback. They're currently planning to convert their top floor to storage units and will proceed with the installation once that's done.

## Why flat roofs work brilliantly

Flat roofs give us flexibility that pitched roofs don't - we can mount panels pointing south regardless of building orientation. Bolton's commercial properties often have large flat roofs generating zero value. We turn those into profit centres producing savings for decades. Even properties with pitched roofs work well, particularly larger buildings with extensive roof areas.

If you have spare land, grass verges, or outdoor space, ground-mounted solar supplements rooftop installations or powers [EV charging points](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) for staff vehicles. We've installed ground-mounted systems for businesses offering free staff charging powered entirely by solar - valuable employee benefit at zero ongoing electricity cost.

## Requirements and our approach

You must own the building (not leased), have sufficient roof space or land, and ideally high electricity consumption for best returns. Commercial electricity prices have soared in recent years - many Bolton businesses face bills that have doubled or tripled. For businesses on tight margins, reducing £700-£10,000 monthly costs to near zero can be transformative.
