# Electrical Safety Inspections (EICR) - Greater Manchester

Need an electrical safety check? Whether you're a landlord meeting legal requirements, buying a house, or just want peace of mind about your electrics, we'll sort you out with a proper inspection that won't break the bank.

## What's an EICR and Do You Need One?

An **Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR)** is basically a comprehensive health check for your property's electrics. Think of it like an MOT for your wiring - we test everything to make sure it's safe and up to current standards.

You definitely need one if you're a landlord - it's the law, every 5 years and for new tenants. Buying a house? Get it done before any money changes hands. Selling a property? Buyers will probably want to see one. And if you haven't had your electrics checked in years, it's recommended every 10 years anyway.

## Our EICR Service - £150 All Domestic Properties

**Fixed price of £150 for any domestic property** - doesn't matter if it's a one-bed flat or a five-bed house. You get your inspection and all certificates on the same day with no waiting around for paperwork. We can usually fit you in as soon as you call since EICR inspections slot in easier than our bigger electrical jobs.

## What We Actually Check

We don't just have a quick look and tick some boxes. A proper EICR involves:

**Visual inspection** covers all your wiring, switches, sockets, and consumer unit condition. We're looking for signs of damage, overheating, or general wear and tear, plus checking whether everything still looks fit for purpose.

**Electrical testing** is where the proper technical work happens. We do continuity testing to check circuits are properly connected, insulation resistance testing to make sure wires aren't going to give you a shock, earth fault loop impedance testing so safety systems work properly, and RCD testing to ensure those trip switches that protect you actually work when they're needed.

### Documentation

You get a detailed report explaining what we found, plus all the certificates you need for insurance, selling, or rental compliance.

## Understanding Your EICR Results

We explain everything in plain English, but here's what the codes mean: **C1 (Code 1)** means immediate danger that needs fixing now before we leave. **C2 (Code 2)** is potentially dangerous and needs sorting urgently. **C3 (Code 3)** means it could be better - not dangerous but worth improving when you get the chance. **FI** means we need to investigate something further to give you a proper answer.

If you get C1 or C2 issues, we'll explain exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. No scary technical jargon or trying to panic you into unnecessary work. **[If you need any remedial electrical work sorting, we handle that too](/services/)**

## Different Properties, Different Problems

### Victorian Terraces (Common in Prestwich, Whitefield)

Older houses have their own particular challenges. You're often dealing with old wiring systems like cloth-covered cables or knob and tube wiring that's decades past its best. Inadequate earthing is common because proper earthing wasn't really a thing back when these houses were built. The circuits were designed for gas lighting and a few basic electrical items, not the demands of modern life with washing machines, electric showers, and all the gadgets we use today. Plus those ancient fuse boxes offer no RCD protection whatsoever.

Here's a fun fact: 70% of electrical fires happen in buildings built before 1950. That's exactly why a proper inspection matters so much for these older properties.

### New Builds (Like Altrincham, Trafford Developments)

You'd think new builds would be perfect, but research shows **1 in 5 new builds have electrical faults**. Poor workmanship from rushed construction where corners get cut is surprisingly common. Loose connections that weren't properly tightened during installation, missing earth bonding that should be there but isn't, and incorrect installations like downlights where the earth wires have just been cut off rather than connected properly.

Even if you've got a new build with an EIC certificate, an EICR can give you peace of mind that everything's actually been done right.

## For Landlords - The Legal Bit

**Legal requirement:** EICR every 5 years, plus one for each new tenant. The penalties are serious if you don't comply - fines up to **£30,000**, local authorities can arrange work and bill you for it, and tenancy deposit schemes might get involved.

What you need to do is pretty straightforward: give existing tenants the report within 28 days, give new tenants the report before they move in, and if we find C1, C2, or FI issues, get them fixed within 28 days. Keep records of everything because you'll need to prove compliance if anyone asks.

**HMOs get the same treatment** - no different requirements, just the standard 5-year cycle. **[Need an EICR for your rental property? Book it in today](/contact/)**

## For Property Buyers - Protect Your Investment

**Get an EICR before any money changes hands.** If we find problems like an ancient fuse box that needs replacing, you can negotiate the repair cost off the purchase price, walk away if the issues are too serious, or at least know exactly what you're getting into.

**Even solicitors recommend it** because they know electrical problems can cost thousands to fix later. Better to find out now than get a nasty surprise after you've moved in.

## What Happens If We Find Problems?

**No panic, no pressure.** If we spot issues, we'll explain everything clearly - what's wrong, why it matters, and what needs doing. You'll get fair quotes for any work with no hidden costs or inflated prices. We can fix what we find too, so why get someone else involved? Remedial work gets scheduled within a month, which gives you time to sort things out properly.

We've been doing this for 20+ years, so we've seen it all. Most problems aren't as scary as they sound once you understand what's actually going on. **[If you need electrical problems fixed after an inspection, we handle all types of electrical work](/services/)**
