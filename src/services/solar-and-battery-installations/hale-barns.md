We provide [solar panel and battery installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) throughout Hale Barns. We're an [MCS-certified installer](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) based in North Manchester, and we're experienced with the substantial properties that characterise this area.

Every installation is personally overseen by [Ashley Merritt](/about/), a fully qualified electrician with over 15 years of experience. When you enquire with us, an electrician surveys your property and designs your system - we don't employ salespeople.

## Hale Barns properties and solar suitability

Hale Barns is home to some of Greater Manchester's largest residential properties. The area is dominated by detached homes on generous plots, often with substantial roof space - ideal for larger solar installations.

Energy bills on these properties can be significant. Annual electricity costs of £3,000-6,000+ are common for larger homes with multiple occupants, home offices, and higher than average consumption. Solar and battery systems sized appropriately for these properties can make a real impact on those bills.

Many Hale Barns properties have the roof space for 15-25+ panels, and we're comfortable designing and installing systems at this scale. We do a custom assessment for every property, considering roof orientation, shading, and your actual energy consumption.

## System sizing for larger properties

Where a typical 3-bed semi might have a 4kW system, many Hale Barns homes benefit from 6-10kW systems or larger. We size systems based on your actual usage and roof characteristics, not by maximising panel count.

We have experience with larger installations - we've recently completed a 110-panel commercial system and we're currently quoting on a 600-panel project. Larger domestic systems don't phase us, and we're comfortable with three-phase supplies and larger inverters where needed.

## Equipment we install

We're approved installers for **AlphaESS**, a Cheshire-based manufacturer of premium battery systems. AlphaESS produce high-quality inverters and batteries, and we're listed on their [find an installer](https://www.alpha-ess.com/) page. We're also **Solax approved installers**.

We use quality panels including DMEGC and Trina Vertex. If you have a preference for a specific manufacturer, we can accommodate that - we're not locked into exclusive deals that limit what we can offer.

All installations come with a **30-year warranty on panels** and **10-year warranty on batteries**.

## Why the installer matters

We've seen other installers recommend dangerous setups - batteries installed in lofts, for example, which directly contradicts NAPIT safety guidelines. This happens when salespeople spec jobs instead of qualified electricians.

With Renegade, the person who surveys your property understands the technical requirements. We won't recommend something that's unsafe or unsuitable just to make a sale. We follow NAPIT guidelines properly, and all electrical work is done in-house by qualified electricians - we don't subcontract.

## Battery storage and time-of-use tariffs

Many Hale Barns customers combine solar with battery storage. The battery charges from solar generation during the day and from cheap overnight electricity on tariffs like Octopus Intelligent or Octopus Go. It then powers the house during expensive peak periods.

For properties where roof-mounted solar isn't the best option - due to shading or orientation - we offer [battery-only solutions](/services/home-battery-installations/) that work well with time-of-use tariffs.

We're an [Octopus Energy Trusted Partner](/accreditations/octopus-trusted-partner/), vetted by Octopus for quality installations.

## EPC ratings and property value

Installing renewable energy increases your EPC rating, which can increase property value. Every property nowadays needs an EPC, and in an area like Hale Barns where property values are significant, this is worth considering alongside the energy bill savings.

## 0% VAT on solar and battery

As MCS-certified installers, our solar panel and battery installations qualify for 0% VAT. This applies to domestic properties and makes a meaningful difference to the overall cost.
