[Renegade Solar](/about/) provides expert [solar panel and battery installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) throughout Bolton. As an [MCS-certified installer](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) based in North Manchester, we bring our expertise directly to Bolton homeowners and businesses looking to reduce energy bills and carbon footprints.

We've successfully installed solar systems on a wide variety of Bolton properties - from traditional terraced houses to larger detached homes and commercial buildings. Every installation is personally overseen by [Ashley Merritt](/about/), a fully qualified electrician with over 15 years of experience who understands the unique characteristics of Bolton's diverse housing stock.

## Solar Performance in Bolton

Many Bolton residents ask us if solar panels are effective in Greater Manchester's changeable weather. The answer is a resounding yes! Modern solar panels work efficiently even on cloudy days, generating at 80%+ of their capacity without direct sunlight.

Bolton's position well connected to the motorway network makes us ideally placed to serve the area efficiently, and we've completed numerous installations across the borough.

## Property Types in Bolton

Bolton is the UK's largest town with around 280,000 residents, and its housing reflects its rich industrial heritage. Terraced and semi-detached properties make up 70% of Bolton's housing stock - a legacy of the town's mill worker cottages from when over 200 cotton mills operated here.

We frequently work with Bolton's characteristic terraced properties in areas like Farnworth (average property price £168k), Great Lever, and Deane, where careful system design maximises generation within available roof space. For larger homes in Bolton's premium postcodes like Belmont, Bromley Cross, and Egerton (average £282k), we can design more substantial systems.

Bolton's industrial heritage means the town has excellent commercial opportunities. With substantial warehouses and manufacturing facilities across the borough, plus a growing logistics sector, Bolton's business community can benefit enormously from [commercial solar installations](/services/commercial-solar-installations/) with their generous roof space and high daytime energy consumption.

For properties where conventional solar installation isn't suitable (due to shading, orientation, or planning restrictions), we offer [battery-only solutions](/services/home-battery-installations/) that work brilliantly with time-of-use tariffs like [Octopus Energy's](https://octopus.energy/tariffs/).

## Local Knowledge & Personal Service

What sets us apart from national installers is our personal approach. Ashley personally oversees every aspect of your installation - from initial survey through design and installation to final commissioning. He's your direct point of contact throughout, not a salesperson or a call centre.

Our local knowledge means we understand Bolton's planning requirements and have experience with the specific property types across the borough. We can typically complete most installations within a week with minimal disruption.
