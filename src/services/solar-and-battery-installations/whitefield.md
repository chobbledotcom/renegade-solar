Based just down the road in Prestwich, we know Whitefield well. We've probably fitted solar panels and batteries to buildings just like yours, and can offer some real world knowledge about the amount of energy your house is likely to generate, store, and consume.

We've installed solar panels on:

- Traditional terraced houses with slate roofs
- Semi-detached homes with large roof areas
- Modern new-build properties
- Commercial buildings with flat roofs

And we've even installed ground-mounted solar panels for properties with large gardens!

## How Do Solar Panel Perform In The Rain?

It feels like we're never more than a day or two away from a rainy day in Manchester (although we were surprised to learn that [we're not even close to being the rainiest city](https://blog.scienceandindustrymuseum.org.uk/manchester-our-rainy-city/)!), but you might be surprised to learn that this isn't actually a problem for solar panel set ups. In fact, the rain helps keep the panels clean, which _increases_ their efficiency!

## Can I Just Get A Battery?

Of course! A [a battery-only installation](/services/home-battery-installations/) can still save you a significant amount on your bills each day, as long as you're on a "Time of Use" tariff, and most energy companies offer this now. These tariffs mean you can charge your battery overnight when the electricity is cheaper (as little as 1/3rd) the price in some instances, ready to use throughout the day! While a little energy is lost in the process of filling your battery, this is easily offset by using the cheaper electricity for more of your day.
