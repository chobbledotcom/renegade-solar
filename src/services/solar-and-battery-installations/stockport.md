We provide expert [solar panel and battery installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) throughout Stockport, including [Marple](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/marple/), Marple Bridge, [Bramhall](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/bramhall/), and surrounding areas. As an [MCS-certified installer](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) based in North Manchester, we bring our expertise directly to Stockport homeowners looking to reduce energy bills and carbon footprints.

We've successfully installed solar systems on a wide variety of Stockport properties - from the elegant Victorian and Edwardian homes in [Bramhall](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/bramhall/) to the charming stone cottages in Marple Bridge. Our team is led by [Ashley Merritt](/about/), a fully qualified electrician with over 15 years of experience who understands the unique characteristics of Stockport's housing stock.

## Solar Performance in Stockport

Many Stockport residents ask us if solar panels are effective in Manchester's famously changeable weather. The answer is a resounding yes! Modern solar panels work efficiently even on cloudy days, generating at 80%+ of their capacity without direct sunlight. The [Bramhall](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/bramhall/) and Marple Bridge areas actually benefit from slightly higher elevation than central Manchester, often resulting in better solar exposure throughout the year.

## Property Types in Stockport

Stockport's diverse architecture presents exciting opportunities for solar installation. In [Bramhall](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/bramhall/), we frequently work with larger detached and semi-detached homes with ample roof space, ideal for maximising solar generation. Properties in [Marple](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/marple/) and Marple Bridge, with their mix of traditional stone buildings and newer developments, often benefit from our custom system designs that respect the architectural character while delivering excellent performance.

For properties where conventional solar installation isn't suitable (due to shading, orientation, or planning restrictions), we offer [battery-only solutions](/services/home-battery-installations/) that work brilliantly with time-of-use tariffs like [Octopus Energy's](https://octopus.energy/tariffs/) - particularly valuable for homeowners in conservation areas around [Marple](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/marple/) or listed buildings in [Bramhall](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/bramhall/).

## Local Knowledge & Personal Service

What sets us apart from national installers is our personal approach. Ashley personally oversees every aspect of your installation - from initial survey through design and installation to final commissioning. He's your direct point of contact throughout, not a salesperson or a call centre.

Our local knowledge means we understand Stockport's planning requirements and have experience with the specific property types in areas like [Bramhall](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/bramhall/) and [Marple](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/marple/). We can typically complete most installations within a week with minimal disruption to your household.
