We provide [solar panel and battery installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) throughout Hale. We're an [MCS-certified installer](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) based in North Manchester, and we're familiar with the area's substantial properties and conservation area considerations around South Hale.

Every installation is personally overseen by [Ashley Merritt](/about/), a fully qualified electrician with over 15 years of experience. When you enquire with us, an electrician surveys your property and designs your system - we don't employ salespeople.

## Hale properties and solar suitability

Hale's housing stock is predominantly larger detached properties with generous roof space - ideal for solar installations. Many homes here have higher energy consumption than the Manchester average, which means solar and battery systems can make a significant difference to energy bills.

Period properties are common throughout Hale, including Victorian and Edwardian homes with slate roofs. These often have good south-facing aspects and solid roof structures. We're experienced with these property types and can advise on what's realistic for your specific situation.

Parts of Hale fall within conservation areas, including South Hale and the area around Hale Station. This doesn't mean you can't have solar panels, but it does mean we need to consider visibility and may need to discuss planning with the local authority. As part of our MCS accreditation, we're trained on working with conservation requirements and can advise on what's achievable.

## System sizing for larger properties

Hale properties typically suit larger systems than average. Where a typical 3-bed semi might have a 4kW system, many Hale homes benefit from 6-10kW systems (15-25 panels) to match higher energy consumption.

We size systems based on your actual usage and roof characteristics, not by maximising panel count. We do a custom assessment for every property, considering roof orientation, shading, and your energy consumption patterns.

We have experience with larger installations - we've recently completed a 110-panel commercial system and we're currently quoting on a 600-panel project. Larger domestic systems don't phase us, and we're comfortable with three-phase supplies and larger inverters where needed.

## Equipment we install

We're approved installers for **AlphaESS**, a Cheshire-based manufacturer of premium battery systems. AlphaESS produce high-quality inverters and batteries, and we're listed on their [find an installer](https://www.alpha-ess.com/) page. We're also **Solax approved installers**.

We use quality panels including DMEGC and Trina Vertex. If you have a preference for a specific manufacturer, we can accommodate that - we're not locked into exclusive deals that limit what we can offer.

All installations come with a **30-year warranty on panels** and **10-year warranty on batteries**.

## Why the installer matters

We've seen other installers recommend dangerous setups - batteries installed in lofts, for example, which directly contradicts NAPIT safety guidelines. This happens when salespeople spec jobs instead of qualified electricians.

With Renegade, the person who surveys your property understands the technical requirements. We won't recommend something that's unsafe or unsuitable just to make a sale. We follow NAPIT guidelines properly, and all electrical work is done in-house by qualified electricians - we don't subcontract.

## Battery storage and time-of-use tariffs

Many Hale customers combine solar with battery storage. The battery charges from solar generation during the day and from cheap overnight electricity on tariffs like Octopus Intelligent or Octopus Go. It then powers the house during expensive peak periods.

For properties where roof-mounted solar isn't suitable - due to shading, orientation, or conservation restrictions - we offer [battery-only solutions](/services/home-battery-installations/) that work well with time-of-use tariffs.

We're an [Octopus Energy Trusted Partner](/accreditations/octopus-trusted-partner/), vetted by Octopus for quality installations.

## EPC ratings and property value

Installing renewable energy increases your EPC rating, which can increase property value. In an area like Hale where property values are significant, this is worth considering alongside the energy bill savings.

## 0% VAT on solar and battery

As MCS-certified installers, our solar panel and battery installations qualify for 0% VAT. This applies to domestic properties and makes a meaningful difference to the overall cost.
