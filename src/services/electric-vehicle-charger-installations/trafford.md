Expert EV charger installations throughout Trafford. NAPIT-registered service providing smart charging solutions for electric cars with renewable energy integration capabilities.

## Trafford EV Charging Service

We serve the entire Trafford area with professional EV charger installations, from Altrincham to Sale and beyond. Our expertise covers all property types and electrical configurations.

## Cost Comparison

Public chargers cost 30-60p per kWh. Get on a time-of-use tariff like Octopus Go and you're paying 7.5p overnight at home. That's a massive difference for anyone doing regular driving. Manchester's motorway network (M60, M56, M6) means rapid chargers aren't hard to find for long trips, but daily charging at home is way cheaper.

With the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars approaching, more people are making the switch. A 7kW home charger gets your car charged overnight during the cheap window. Granny chargers that plug into regular sockets? They take all day, so you end up charging during expensive daytime rates.

## What We Fit

We're an **Octopus Energy Trusted Partner**, installing their full [EV charger range](https://octopus.energy/get-an-ev-charger/). These smart chargers wait for cheap rates before charging - you plug in, they sort the timing. On Octopus Go that's 7.5p per kWh overnight.

If you're running **Solax** or **AlphaESS** solar or battery systems, we fit their chargers too. They integrate with their own equipment nicely.

Bought a different charger already? No problem. We'll install whatever you've ordered.

## The Install

Chargers are weatherproof units that can go wherever suits your parking - garage wall, house wall, outside. Cable runs from your consumer unit to the charger. If that means going outside, we use heavy duty armoured cable built for it.

Jobs get done in a day, mess is kept minimal. Your consumer unit needs to meet current standards - if you've had solar or battery work done, it'll be fine. Even without solar, you can get a time-of-use tariff for cheap overnight car charging.
