Expert EV charger installations throughout Blackley. As your local NAPIT-registered installer, we provide professional charging solutions for electric cars tailored to your property and driving needs.

## Local EV Charging Service

Based nearby in Prestwich, we serve the Blackley area with comprehensive EV charger installation services. Our local knowledge ensures installations that work perfectly with your home's electrical system.

## Charging Your Car at Home

You'll need a 7kW charger to make the most of cheap overnight rates. Granny chargers that plug into regular sockets are slow - they'll take all day, which means you're charging during expensive daytime hours. A proper wall-mounted charger gets your car topped up overnight when electricity is dirt cheap.

The chargers are weatherproof, so we can mount them outside no problem. Garage wall, house wall, wherever works for your parking. Cable runs from your consumer unit to the charger - if that's a long run or needs to go outside, we use heavy duty armoured cable that's built for it.

Installations are wrapped up in a day, mess is minimal. Your consumer unit needs to meet current standards, but if you've had solar or battery work done already, it will. You don't need solar to get cheap overnight electricity though - time-of-use tariffs are available to anyone.

## The Chargers We Fit

We're an **Octopus Energy Trusted Partner**, so we install the full [Octopus EV charger range](https://octopus.energy/get-an-ev-charger/). These are smart chargers that automatically charge when electricity is cheapest - you just plug in and they sort the rest. On Octopus Go that's 7.5p per kWh overnight, compared to 30-60p at public chargers.

If you're running **Solax** or **AlphaESS** solar panels or batteries, their chargers integrate nicely. We fit those regularly.

Already ordered a charger yourself? That's fine. We'll install whatever you've got.

## Electric Cars Are Coming

The 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars is getting closer. Blackley's well connected to Manchester's motorways (M60, M62), so rapid chargers for longer trips aren't hard to find. But for everyday driving - work, shops, school runs - home charging at 7.5p per kWh beats paying 30-60p at public chargers every time.
