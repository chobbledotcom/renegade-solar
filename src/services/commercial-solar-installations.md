# Commercial Solar Installations in Greater Manchester

If your business is spending hundreds or thousands of pounds each month on electricity, commercial solar could slash those costs to near zero. We design and install commercial solar systems that deliver a payback period as short as three to four years, with decades of free energy afterward. Whether you run a factory, retail outlet, hotel, cafe, bakery, or any commercial property with high electricity consumption, we'll create a tailored solar solution that makes financial sense.

## Why commercial solar is a no-brainer

Commercial electricity prices have soared in recent years, with many businesses struggling under bills that have doubled or tripled. We've worked with businesses spending £700 to £10,000+ per month on electricity - and in many cases, we can reduce that to zero while generating income from excess energy sold back to the grid.

The mathematics are simple: if you own your building and have roof space or land available, solar installation typically pays for itself within 3-4 years. After that, you're looking at 20+ years of free electricity and protection from future price rises. For businesses on tight margins, this can be the difference between thriving and going under.

## Perfect properties for commercial solar

### Flat roofs

Flat roofs are brilliant for commercial solar because panels can be mounted to point south regardless of the building's orientation. We've designed systems for retail units, warehouses, and commercial properties with large flat roofs that generate substantial energy throughout the day.

### Pitched roofs

Large pitched roofs on factories, hotels, or commercial buildings offer excellent solar potential. We regularly work with properties that have extensive roof space going unused - perfect for solar panel arrays.

### Ground-mounted systems

If you have spare land, grass verges, or outdoor space, ground-mounted solar is an excellent option. We've installed systems for businesses wanting to power EV charging points for staff vehicles or supplement rooftop installations.

## Real commercial installations

### Retail and warehousing

We're working with a Bolton carpet and interior design shop spending £700 monthly on electricity. Our solar design brings that bill down to zero, with the system paying for itself in three years. After that, it's pure profit and free energy for decades.

### EV charging for staff

We've installed ground-mounted solar connected to outdoor fuse boards, allowing businesses to offer free EV charging to staff powered entirely by solar energy. This delivers a valuable employee benefit at zero ongoing cost while demonstrating environmental commitment.

### High-consumption businesses

Bakeries, food manufacturing, cold storage facilities, factories running machinery - these businesses often face crippling electricity costs. Solar installations can dramatically reduce operating expenses while future-proofing the business against further price rises.

## Who commercial solar works for

Commercial solar delivers the strongest returns for:

- **Factories and manufacturing** - Heavy machinery and production equipment mean high electricity consumption and excellent solar payback
- **Food businesses** - Bakeries, cafes, restaurants with commercial kitchens and refrigeration
- **Retail and hospitality** - Hotels, shops, Premier Inns, and commercial properties with large roofs
- **Cold storage** - Freezer facilities and temperature-controlled warehousing
- **Any high-consumption business** - If you're spending significant amounts on electricity, solar likely makes financial sense

## Off-grid commercial solar

For businesses in rural locations or where grid connection is prohibitively expensive, we design and install off-grid solar systems. These can power mobile catering businesses, remote offices, agricultural operations, or any commercial property without convenient mains electricity access.

Off-grid systems eliminate generator costs and ongoing fuel expenses while positioning your business as environmentally conscious. We've successfully delivered several off-grid installations and can design systems sized to your specific power requirements.

## The installation process

### 1. Commercial survey and design

We assess your property, review your electricity usage, and create detailed designs showing energy generation, cost savings, and payback period. You'll receive clear projections based on your actual consumption patterns.

### 2. Multiple design options

We typically provide several design options - perhaps flat roof only, pitched roof only, or combined installations. Each comes with detailed financial analysis so you can make an informed decision about which approach delivers the best return for your business.

### 3. Professional installation

All installations are completed professionally with minimal disruption to your business operations. We coordinate timing to suit your needs and ensure work is completed efficiently.

### 4. Grid connection and certification

We handle all grid connection requirements, necessary certifications, and set up export arrangements so you can earn income from excess electricity generation.

## Financial benefits

### Immediate cost reduction

From the moment your system is commissioned, you'll see dramatically reduced electricity bills. Many businesses reduce monthly costs by 70-100%.

### Export income

Excess electricity is sold back to the grid through the Smart Export Guarantee, creating an additional income stream for your business.

### Rapid payback

Most commercial installations deliver payback in 3-4 years, significantly faster than domestic installations due to higher consumption and better utilisation of generated energy.

### Long-term savings

With 20+ years of expected system life, you're looking at potentially hundreds of thousands of pounds in electricity cost savings over the system's lifetime.

### Property value increase

Commercial properties with installed solar systems are increasingly attractive to buyers and tenants, particularly as environmental considerations become more important.

## Requirements

To qualify for commercial solar installation:

- **You must own the building** - The roof and property must be yours, not leased or rented
- **Sufficient roof space or land** - Adequate south-facing or flat roof area, or available land for ground mounting
- **High electricity consumption** - The more electricity you use, the better the financial returns
- **Long-term ownership plans** - Best returns come from owning the property long-term to maximise payback
