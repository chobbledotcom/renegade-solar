# Commercial Solar Installations in Greater Manchester

If your business is spending hundreds or thousands each month on electricity, commercial solar could slash those costs to near zero. We design and install systems that deliver payback in as little as three years, with 20+ years of free energy afterward. Whether you run a factory, retail outlet, hotel, cafe, or bakery, we'll create a tailored [solar solution](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) that makes financial sense.

## Why commercial solar works

Commercial electricity prices have soared in recent years. One [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/) baker we spoke to is spending £10,000 monthly and nearly went under because of it. A [Bolton](/commercial-solar-installations-bolton/) carpet shop we're designing for spends £700 monthly - our 50-panel flat roof system brings that to zero with three-year payback. After that, it's 20+ years of free electricity and protection from future price rises.

## Real examples from Greater Manchester

**Horwich Interior Designs & Carpets** - £700/month electricity bill, large flat roof perfect for solar. Our design: 50+ panels on the flat roof reducing bills to zero, with a second option adding pitched roof coverage for 115 panels total. Three-year payback, then decades of free energy while selling excess back to the grid.

**Staff EV charging** - We've installed ground-mounted [solar panels](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) connected to outdoor fuse boards, letting businesses offer free EV charging to staff. Eliminates fuel costs, provides valuable employee benefits, and demonstrates environmental commitment - all powered by solar.

## Perfect properties for commercial solar

**Flat roofs** are brilliant for commercial solar because panels can be mounted to point south regardless of building orientation. Retail units, warehouses, and commercial properties with large flat roofs generate substantial energy throughout the day.

**Pitched roofs** on factories, hotels (like Premier Inns), or commercial buildings offer excellent potential. Large roof spaces currently going unused are perfect for solar panel arrays that dramatically reduce operating costs.

**Ground-mounted systems** work well if you have spare land or grass verges. Ideal for powering [EV charging points](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) or supplementing rooftop installations.

## Who benefits most

- **Factories and manufacturing** - Heavy machinery means high consumption and excellent payback
- **Food businesses** - Bakeries, cafes, restaurants with commercial kitchens and refrigeration (Slattery's bakery in Prestwich spends £10,000/month)
- **Retail and hospitality** - Hotels, carpet shops, retail outlets with large roofs
- **Cold storage** - Freezer facilities and temperature-controlled warehousing
- **Any high-consumption business** - The more you spend, the faster the payback

## Off-grid options

For rural locations or where grid connection is prohibitively expensive, we design off-grid solar systems for mobile catering businesses, remote offices, or agricultural operations. This eliminates generator costs and ongoing fuel expenses while positioning your business as environmentally conscious.

## Installation process

We assess your property and electricity usage, then create detailed designs showing energy generation, cost savings, and payback period based on your actual consumption. You'll typically get multiple options (flat roof only, pitched roof only, or combined) with financial analysis for each. All installations are completed with minimal business disruption, and we handle grid connection, certifications, and Smart Export Guarantee setup for selling excess electricity.

## Financial benefits

From commissioning, you'll see 70-100% reduction in electricity bills, with payback typically within 3-4 years - faster than domestic installations due to higher daytime consumption. With 20+ year system life, that's potentially hundreds of thousands saved. Commercial properties with solar are increasingly attractive to buyers and tenants as environmental considerations grow.

## Requirements

- **You must own the building** - No leased or rented properties
- **Sufficient roof space or land** - South-facing, flat roof, or available ground space
- **High electricity consumption** - Better returns for higher usage
- **Long-term ownership** - Best payback requires owning the property long-term
