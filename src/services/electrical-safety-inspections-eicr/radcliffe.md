# EICR Electrical Safety Inspections in Radcliffe

Professional electrical safety inspections throughout Radcliffe from experienced NAPIT-registered electricians. £150 for all domestic properties - same day certificates with no waiting around.

## Radcliffe's Established Housing Areas

Radcliffe has a solid mix of properties, from traditional terraced houses around the town centre to modern family homes in the surrounding developments. Each type brings its own electrical considerations that need proper professional assessment.

**Traditional properties** throughout Radcliffe often have electrical systems that have grown and changed over many years. Original installations put in for basic lighting and minimal electrical use have been extended to cope with modern family life - washing machines, electric showers, tumble dryers, and all the electrical items we depend on today.

**Modern housing estates** around Radcliffe should be more straightforward, but even recent builds can surprise you. Industry research shows that 1 in 5 new builds still have electrical installation problems, often from poor workmanship or corners cut during construction.

## Our Radcliffe EICR Service - £150 All Properties

**£150 for any domestic property in Radcliffe** - whether you're in a compact terrace or a larger family home, the price doesn't change.

We provide same day certificates and can usually fit you in quickly. EICR inspections are easier to schedule around other electrical work, so we can often help with short notice requests.

## For Radcliffe Landlords

Radcliffe's rental market serves local families and working people, so landlords need to maintain proper electrical safety standards. **EICR every 5 years plus one for each new tenant** - that's what the law requires.

Penalties for not having proper electrical certificates are serious - fines up to £30,000, plus local councils can arrange expensive remedial work and bill you for it. Give existing tenants the report within 28 days, new tenants get it before they move in.

**Radcliffe's mix of property ages** means you might be dealing with anything from older terraced houses to modern family homes, each with different electrical setups and potential issues.

## For Radcliffe Property Buyers

**Get an EICR before any money changes hands.** Radcliffe properties are important investments for local families, so you want to know about any electrical problems before you commit.

If we find issues like an old fuse box or dodgy wiring (more likely in older Radcliffe properties), you can use this information to negotiate on price or decide whether to proceed with the purchase.

Much better to find out about a potential £1,500 electrical upgrade during your house purchase than discover it after you've moved in.

## Radcliffe Property Types

**Older terraced and semi-detached houses** (common throughout established Radcliffe areas) often have:

- Electrical systems that have been upgraded bit by bit over time
- Old-style consumer units that don't meet current safety standards
- Not enough electrical circuits for modern household needs
- Earthing systems that need bringing up to current requirements

**Modern family homes** in Radcliffe's newer areas can still have problems:

- Installation quality that depends on which builder and electricians did the work
- Electrical work that meets basic requirements but could be better
- RCD protection that doesn't fully meet current best practices
- Problems with earth bonding in bathrooms and kitchens

## Thorough Electrical Testing

**Complete visual inspection** of all electrical installations you can see - wiring, switches, sockets, and your consumer unit. We check for damage, signs of overheating, and general condition.

**Technical testing** with proper calibrated equipment. This includes continuity testing, insulation resistance measurement, earth fault loop impedance testing, and checking your RCDs actually work when they're supposed to.

**Same day paperwork** - you get your EICR certificate and a detailed report explaining any problems we find, written in language that makes sense.

## Local Knowledge

We work regularly throughout Radcliffe and know the common electrical issues in different types of properties and areas. Whether you're dealing with an older house that's been well looked after or a newer home where you want to check the installation quality, local experience helps.

Radcliffe's mix of property ages means electrical setups can be quite different even in the same street. Knowing what's normal and what needs attention comes from experience working in the local area.

## When We Find Problems

**Straight talking without sales pressure.** If we find electrical issues, we'll explain clearly what's wrong, why it matters, and what your options are. You get honest prices for any work that needs doing, without inflated costs or unnecessary extras.

We can sort out any electrical problems we find during the inspection. No need to find other electricians and start again - we'll schedule the work within a month.
