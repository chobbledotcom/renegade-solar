NAPIT-registered with 20+ years' experience and a [9.61/10 Checkatrade rating](https://www.checkatrade.com/trades/renegadeelectrical/).

Same-day certificates mean no waiting. If we find C1 or C2 issues, we'll explain them clearly and quote fairly for fixes. No scaremongering – just facts.

## Buying in Crumpsall?

Get an EICR before completing. Crumpsall's mix of post-war semis, Victorian terraces, and newer builds all have their quirks. It's better to find problems before purchase than after.

## We Know Crumpsall Properties

Post-war semis often have deteriorating wiring. Victorian terraces near the hospital have mixed-era electrics. Even new builds can have corners cut – and we've inspected them all.

If repairs are needed, we'll handle everything. Consumer unit upgrades, RCD protection, proper earthing – all at fair prices with no pressure.
