# EICR Electrical Safety Inspections in Prestwich

Need an EICR in Prestwich? I'm Ashley from Renegade Solar, your local NAPIT-registered electrician. I provide professional electrical safety inspections for £150 - same day certificates, no waiting around.

## Why Prestwich Properties Need Regular EICRs

Prestwich has a brilliant mix of Victorian terraced houses and more modern properties, but that means different electrical challenges. Those beautiful Victorian terraces around the town centre and near Heaton Park often have electrical systems that weren't designed for modern life - we're talking about wiring originally installed for gas lighting that's been adapted over the decades.

**Common issues we find in Prestwich Victorian properties:**

- Original cloth-covered wiring from the early 1900s
- Fuse boxes without any RCD protection
- Inadequate earthing systems
- Circuits overloaded by modern electrical demands

The newer developments around Prestwich have their own challenges too. Research shows 1 in 5 new builds have electrical faults from poor workmanship or rushed installation work.

## My Prestwich EICR Service - £150 Fixed Price

**£150 for any domestic property in Prestwich** - whether you're in a compact Victorian terrace or a larger modern house, the price stays the same.

I can usually fit you in quickly - EICR inspections slot in easier than bigger electrical jobs, and you get all your certificates on the same day. No waiting for paperwork in the post.

## For Prestwich Landlords

**Legal requirement:** EICR every 5 years plus one for each new tenant. With Prestwich's healthy rental market, you need to stay compliant.

The penalties for not having an EICR are serious - fines up to £30,000. Give existing tenants the report within 28 days, new tenants get it before they move in. If we find C1, C2, or FI issues, get them sorted within 28 days.

Prestwich landlords particularly need to watch out for older properties where electrical systems might not meet current standards. Better to find out now than face problems later.

## For Prestwich Property Buyers

**Get an EICR before any money changes hands.** With Prestwich's mix of property ages, you really want to know what you're taking on.

If we find problems like an outdated fuse box (common in older Prestwich properties), you can negotiate repair costs off the purchase price or walk away if issues are too serious. Much better than discovering a £3,000 rewiring job after you've moved in.

## Understanding Prestwich's Property Types

**Victorian terraces** (common around Prestwich Village and near the tram stops) present particular challenges. These properties often have:

- Electrical systems upgraded piecemeal over decades
- Limited circuits for modern electrical loads
- Earthing that doesn't meet current standards
- Consumer units that need updating

**Modern developments** around the outskirts might seem safer, but I still find installation issues like loose connections, missing earth bonding, or incorrectly installed protective devices.

## What I Check in Your Prestwich Property

**Visual inspection** of all wiring, switches, sockets, and your consumer unit. I'm looking for damage, overheating, or wear and tear.

**Electrical testing** includes continuity testing, insulation resistance, earth fault loop impedance, and RCD testing. This isn't just a quick look - it's proper technical assessment using calibrated test equipment.

**Same day documentation** - you get your EICR certificate and detailed report explaining any findings in plain English.

## Local Knowledge Matters

I know Prestwich well and understand the common electrical issues in different parts of the area. Whether you're near the MetroLink station dealing with the vibration effects on older wiring, or in one of the newer developments where build quality varies, local experience makes a difference.

**My customers say:** _"Ashley came out at short notice to do an electrical safety check on my new property"_ - that's the kind of responsive service Prestwich residents expect.

## If I Find Problems

**No panic, no pressure.** If I spot issues, I'll explain clearly what's wrong and why it matters. You get fair quotes for any remedial work with no hidden costs.

I can handle any electrical problems I discover during inspection - why involve someone else? Remedial work gets scheduled within a month, giving you time to plan properly.
