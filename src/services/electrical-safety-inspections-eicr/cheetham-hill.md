# EICR Electrical Safety Inspections in Cheetham Hill

Need an EICR in Cheetham Hill? We're Renegade Solar, led by Ashley, based in nearby Prestwich. It's £150 plus VAT for any domestic property, same day certificate, no hidden extras. With NAPIT registration and over 20 years' experience, we know exactly what to look for in Cheetham Hill's varied properties.

## £150 plus VAT Fixed Price - No Surprises

Whether you've got a compact Victorian terrace or a modern apartment, it's £150 plus VAT. That includes everything – the inspection, certificate, and report. No travel charges, no hidden extras, just £150 plus VAT.

## For Cheetham Hill Landlords

The [law requires](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/312/part/2/made) an EICR every five years and for each new tenancy. Penalties reach £30,000 for non-compliance. We'll get you sorted quickly – usually within a few days of calling.

You'll get the report within 28 days as required, but we actually provide it same day. If we find any C1 or C2 issues, we'll explain exactly what needs fixing and we'll provide fair quotes for the work.

## For Property Buyers

Getting an EICR before buying could save you thousands. Common issues in Cheetham Hill include outdated fuse boxes, dodgy DIY electrical work, and insufficient circuits for modern living. It's better to know before you buy than to discover a £3,000 rewiring job after you've moved in.

## Victorian Terraces to Modern Flats

Cheetham Hill's older properties often have mixed-era wiring, consumer units without RCD protection, and overloaded circuits. Even newer developments can have issues from rushed construction. Ashley's seen it all, so he knows exactly what to check.

If we find problems, we'll explain them clearly without scaremongering. Common fixes include consumer unit upgrades, additional RCD protection, and proper earthing. We handle all remedial work ourselves, so you won't need to find another electrician.

## Why Choose Renegade Solar?

We're minutes away in Prestwich, so you'll get a quick response and no travel charges. Our [9.9/10 Checkatrade rating](https://www.checkatrade.com/trades/renegadeelectrical/) speaks for itself. We explain everything in plain English, not electrical jargon. When you need quick service, we can often come out the same day – just like we did for a recent Blackley customer who needed urgent electrical repairs.
