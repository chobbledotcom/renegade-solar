## Hale Barns properties

Hale Barns is dominated by substantial detached properties, many with extensive electrical installations to match their size.

**Larger properties** have more circuits, more sockets, and often additional features like outbuildings, garages with power supplies, garden lighting, and security systems. All of this needs inspecting, but our price doesn't change based on property size.

**Modern executive homes** might seem like they'd be problem-free, but research shows 1 in 5 new builds still have electrical faults. Poor workmanship during rushed construction phases can create issues that only show up during proper testing.

**Properties with extensions and modifications** are common in Hale Barns. Each addition may have been done by different electricians over the years, with varying standards of workmanship. An EICR tells you whether everything is safe and compliant.

## For Hale Barns landlords

With Hale Barns' strong rental market, landlords need to stay on top of electrical safety compliance. **EICR every 5 years plus one for each new tenant** - it's not optional.

Penalties for non-compliance are serious - fines up to £30,000, plus local authorities can arrange costly remedial work and bill you for it. Give existing tenants the report within 28 days, new tenants before they move in.

## For Hale Barns property buyers

**Get an EICR before any money changes hands.** Hale Barns' property prices mean electrical problems can be expensive surprises you don't want.

Prospective buyers and solicitors are now asking for EICRs. It's not a legal requirement, but people want the confidence that the electrics are safe before committing to a purchase. Given the property values in Hale Barns, it's a sensible precaution.

If we find issues like an outdated consumer unit or inadequate earthing, you can negotiate repair costs off the purchase price. Much better than discovering you need work done after completion.

## Comprehensive EICR testing

**Visual inspection** covers all visible wiring, switches, sockets, and your consumer unit. We check for damage, signs of overheating, and general condition.

**Detailed electrical testing** using calibrated equipment includes continuity testing, insulation resistance measurement, earth fault loop impedance testing, and RCD operation checks. This is proper technical assessment, not just a quick visual check.

**Same day certification** - you get your EICR certificate and comprehensive report explaining any findings in terms that make sense.

## When we find issues

**No pressure, just clear explanations.** If we discover problems, we explain what's wrong, why it matters, and what needs doing. You get honest quotes for any remedial work without inflated prices or unnecessary extras.

We can handle any electrical issues discovered during inspection. Why complicate things by involving multiple contractors? Remedial work gets scheduled quickly.
