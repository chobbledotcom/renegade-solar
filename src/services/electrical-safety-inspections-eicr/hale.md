## Hale's property types

Hale has a mix of period properties and larger modern homes, each with different electrical considerations.

**Period properties** around Hale village often have electrical systems that have evolved over decades. Original installations designed for basic lighting have been extended to cope with modern demands - electric showers, washing machines, tumble dryers, and all the gadgets we rely on today.

**Larger modern properties** might seem like they'd be problem-free, but research shows 1 in 5 new builds still have electrical faults. Poor workmanship during rushed construction phases can create issues that only show up during proper testing.

**Conservation area properties** around South Hale and Hale Station may have had electrical work done with particular constraints. We understand the specific challenges these properties present.

## For Hale landlords

With Hale's strong rental market, landlords need to stay on top of electrical safety compliance. **EICR every 5 years plus one for each new tenant** - it's not optional.

Penalties for non-compliance are serious - fines up to £30,000, plus local authorities can arrange costly remedial work and bill you for it. Give existing tenants the report within 28 days, new tenants before they move in.

## For Hale property buyers

**Get an EICR before any money changes hands.** Hale's property prices mean electrical problems can be expensive surprises you don't want.

Prospective buyers and solicitors are now asking for EICRs. It's not a legal requirement, but people want the confidence that the electrics are safe before committing to a purchase.

If we find issues like an outdated consumer unit or inadequate earthing (common in older properties), you can negotiate repair costs off the purchase price. Much better than discovering you need a rewiring job after completion.

## Comprehensive EICR testing

**Visual inspection** covers all visible wiring, switches, sockets, and your consumer unit. We check for damage, signs of overheating, and general condition.

**Detailed electrical testing** using calibrated equipment includes continuity testing, insulation resistance measurement, earth fault loop impedance testing, and RCD operation checks. This is proper technical assessment, not just a quick visual check.

**Same day certification** - you get your EICR certificate and comprehensive report explaining any findings in terms that make sense.

## When we find issues

**No pressure, just clear explanations.** If we discover problems, we explain what's wrong, why it matters, and what needs doing. You get honest quotes for any remedial work without inflated prices or unnecessary extras.

We can handle any electrical issues discovered during inspection. Why complicate things by involving multiple contractors? Remedial work gets scheduled quickly.
