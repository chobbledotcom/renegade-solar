# Solar and Battery Installations in Manchester

For solar and battery installations you need an electrician with technical expertise and attention to detail.

Renegade Solar guides you through every step of your solar and battery installation.

I provide honest advice, competitive pricing, and quality workmanship to deliver a solar solution that significantly increases your energy independence while meeting safety standards.

With a strong track record of reliability and customer satisfaction, your solar installation is in capable hands.

## Design and Planning

</div>

From start to finish, you will have a personal design specialist going through the different types of installation: on roof, in roof, ground mounted or flat roof. While tailoring a design and quote to suit you, your home or property and your energy needs, every project is different but large or small will all get the same attention to detail.

## Installation

All installations are carried out professionally with minimal disruption to you, your family or your business.

## Commissioning

Your installation will be tested and commissioned to safety and regulatory standards.

## Aftercare

Available to provide assistance with your new installation. 2 years routine maintenance included in all installations.

All equipment comes with at least a 5 year warranty and some panels come with warranty of up to 30 years. We use [DMEGC](/dmegc-solar-panel-installer-manchester/) and Trina Vertex panels, both of which offer long-term warranties and reliable performance.
