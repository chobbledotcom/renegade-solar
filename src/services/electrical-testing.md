# Electrical Testing

Regular electrical testing is about keeping your home and family safe. We carry out full electrical safety checks on properties of all sizes, whether you're a homeowner who wants to know their home electrics are safe or a landlord who needs to meet legal requirements.

Our approach is straightforward: we'll check everything that needs checking, explain what we've found in plain English, and only recommend work that actually needs doing. No hard sell or unnecessary jobs.

The testing process includes:

- Full inspection of your electrical installations
- Testing of circuits and safety devices
- Checking earthing and bonding
- Spotting any potential hazards or worn components
- Clear documentation of findings

We've built our reputation on being honest and reliable - just have a look at [our reviews](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8j3vvkz4uCafyRPN7). We'll get the job done properly, turn up when we say we will, and leave your property clean and tidy. If we do spot any issues that need sorting, we'll explain exactly what needs doing and why, and give you a fair price to put it right.

Whether you need a full "Electrical Installation Condition Report" (EICR) or just want someone to check over a few concerns, give Renegade Solar a call or drop us a message.

We cover the whole Greater Manchester area and can usually sort out testing at fairly short notice if needed.
