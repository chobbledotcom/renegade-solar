His advice even allowed me to keep costs down and his prices were the best quotes I had, with nothing reduced on the quality of his work. An extremely tidy, friendly and reliable tradesman who will not rip you off! All quotes and works were completed within days of contacting him - highly recommend !","createdAt":"2024-05-14T08:17:55.501Z","updatedAt":"2024-05-15T04:18:15.375Z","legacyId":"pFNNwxSmzkJUvT9n6zWz","consumerId":"","categoryId":1547,"topLevelCategoryId":12,"location":{"postcode":"M24"},"verified":"VERIFIED","rating":{"qualityOfWorkmanship":10,"tidiness":10,"reliabilityAndTimekeeping":10,"courtesy":10,"rating":10},"publishedAt":"2024-05-14T16:20:00.808Z","name":"Renegade Electrical Ltd","uniqueName":"renegadeelectrical","mediaAttachments":[],"category":{"id":1547,"label":"Electric Vehicle Charger Installation","name":"electric-vehicle-charger-installation"}}
