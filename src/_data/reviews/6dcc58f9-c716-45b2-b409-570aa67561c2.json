After inspecting, he let us know that it was fully unnecessary and that we just needed a new fuse board. He saved us thousands of pounds with that first visit and he immediately became our go-to electrician.\n\nSince then Ashley has fitted solar panels and a battery, a doorbell, new light sockets, outdoor lighting & power, a bathroom extractor fan, removed old ariels, and probably more stuff I can't remember. I can't fault him at all and have recommended him to my friends.","createdAt":"2024-06-16T16:51:11.951Z","updatedAt":"2024-06-17T12:52:17.997Z","legacyId":"a5EaSDgK12TVfL4wnK2B","consumerId":"","categoryId":1174,"topLevelCategoryId":1172,"location":{"postcode":"M25"},"verified":"VERIFIED","rating":{"qualityOfWorkmanship":10,"tidiness":10,"reliabilityAndTimekeeping":10,"courtesy":10,"rating":10},"publishedAt":"2024-06-17T00:55:00.645Z","name":"Renegade Electrical Ltd","uniqueName":"renegadeelectrical","mediaAttachments":[],"category":{"id":1174,"label":"Solar Panel Installation","name":"solar-panel-installation"}}
