As someone who likes everything to be perfect, I can say he did it exactly how I would have done it (if I had the experience). I highly recommend him to anyone interested in installing solar panels and battery storage.","createdAt":"2024-08-01T12:02:54.513Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-02T08:04:15.330Z","legacyId":"PEO4JJC0EG7nmylE6IAa","consumerId":"066ac04b-5d7f-767f-ae20-126508ff1b31","categoryId":1174,"topLevelCategoryId":1172,"location":{"postcode":"M43"},"verified":"VERIFIED","rating":{"qualityOfWorkmanship":10,"tidiness":10,"reliabilityAndTimekeeping":10,"courtesy":10,"rating":10},"publishedAt":"2024-08-01T20:05:00.998Z","name":"Renegade Electrical Ltd","uniqueName":"renegadeelectrical","mediaAttachments":[],"category":{"id":1174,"label":"Solar Panel Installation","name":"solar-panel-installation"}}
