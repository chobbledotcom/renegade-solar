Renegade gave us a very good quote for the job and so we chose them. This turned out to be a great decision. Ashley did a site inspection and we tweaked the initial design to better suit our location. The installation went ahead on the planned date and the work was completed to a very high standard. We had some additional work carried out at the same time, some due to Ashleys recommendation (e.g. swapping our lighting for LED).\nI highly recommend Renegade as a trustworthy and competent company.","createdAt":"2025-12-09T14:52:19.471Z","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T15:00:08.396Z","legacyId":"","consumerId":"","categoryId":1871,"topLevelCategoryId":1172,"location":{"postcode":"SK4"},"verified":"VERIFIED","rating":{"qualityOfWorkmanship":10,"reliabilityAndTimekeeping":9,"communication":10,"rating":9.67},"publishedAt":"2025-12-10T15:00:08.396Z","name":"Renegade Electrical Ltd","uniqueName":"renegadeelectrical","mediaAttachments":[],"category":{"id":1871,"label":"Solar Battery Storage","name":"solar-battery-storage"}}
