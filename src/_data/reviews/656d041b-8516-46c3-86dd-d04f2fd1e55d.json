Took a couple of hours but really professional job done.  Gave some good advice re future electrical checking needed but didn’t try to upsell - genuinely felt like he was telling me for my own benefit, not his.  Would definitely recommend for any electrical jobs needed.","createdAt":"2023-03-28T17:57:33.406Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-28T17:58:07.000Z","legacyId":"bw3Wle8FAm2jpm5A1pzV","consumerId":"","categoryId":12,"topLevelCategoryId":12,"location":{"postcode":"OL9"},"verified":"VERIFIED","rating":{"qualityOfWorkmanship":10,"tidiness":10,"reliabilityAndTimekeeping":10,"courtesy":10,"rating":10},"publishedAt":"2023-03-28T17:58:07.000Z","name":"Renegade Electrical Ltd","uniqueName":"renegadeelectrical"}
