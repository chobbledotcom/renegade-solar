A quote was provided the same day and we agreed the price.  We opted to provide the sockets, light fittings and switches and Ashley provided everything else e.G.  All the cables and back boxes etc.  We were kept informed with the progress of the works and we agreed on the positions of everything beforehand.  All the sockets have been tested by Ashley and he showed this to us after fitting.  This is a friendly and easy company to deal with and we would recommend it to others who are looking for similar works.","createdAt":"2023-01-19T17:35:08.698Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-19T17:36:07.000Z","legacyId":"rjZ1cvEARjRHoOXxvvR7","consumerId":"","categoryId":12,"topLevelCategoryId":12,"location":{"postcode":"M24"},"verified":"VERIFIED","rating":{"qualityOfWorkmanship":10,"tidiness":10,"reliabilityAndTimekeeping":10,"courtesy":10,"rating":10},"publishedAt":"2023-01-19T17:36:07.000Z","name":"Renegade Electrical Ltd","uniqueName":"renegadeelectrical","mediaAttachments":[],"category":{"id":12,"label":"Electrician","name":"electrician"}}
