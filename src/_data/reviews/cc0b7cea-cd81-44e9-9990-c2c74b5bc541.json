This meant we needed to get someone in to fit a new cable and shower system. Ashley from renegade electrical thankfully quoted for the job with a good price and availability. Ashley was knowledgeable and courteous including checking some details to make sure the job was done and there was no hold ups. He did the job well and checked the system was working well and we were happy with the job. I would definitely recommend Ashley if we need any other electrical work done.","createdAt":"2024-08-23T17:53:02.442Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-24T13:54:43.280Z","legacyId":"rga07tVQ9ByR10XVSak7","consumerId":"066be469-2bca-7fcc-b620-d427723afadf","categoryId":87,"topLevelCategoryId":12,"location":{"postcode":"OL9"},"verified":"VERIFIED","rating":{"qualityOfWorkmanship":9,"tidiness":8,"reliabilityAndTimekeeping":9,"courtesy":10,"rating":9},"publishedAt":"2024-08-24T01:55:00.519Z","name":"Renegade Electrical Ltd","uniqueName":"renegadeelectrical","mediaAttachments":[],"category":{"id":87,"label":"Electric Showers","name":"electric-showers"}}
