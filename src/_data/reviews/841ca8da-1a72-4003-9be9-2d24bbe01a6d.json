It soon became obvious of his limitations in energy storage setups. Despite his limitations he was very keen to take on the project and because of this I decided to offer him the job and agreed do the leg work by getting him all relevant information to make things easier. Having done the legwork Ashley then pulled out without any explanations beside that  it’s best to look for somebody else to do the job and then blocked me from making any further contact. Very unprofessional and discourteous","createdAt":"2024-07-16T04:09:10.046Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-25T09:10:15.467Z","legacyId":"dZvRDq3yNQrE7cu5JWXS","consumerId":"06700393-8d79-7f6d-b120-eb068d876a68","location":{"postcode":"M29"},"reply":{"id":"be1efa71-511c-4127-a8aa-55ae846c4b15","reply":"This is my one negative review out of 70 please read them for yourself . No work was carried out for this chap and there's a very good reason why , I can't say too much on here but he wanted me to do something that is against my values and morals while also protecting my excellent reputation and conduct as a professional tradesman . Please read the police reviews and you will understand .
