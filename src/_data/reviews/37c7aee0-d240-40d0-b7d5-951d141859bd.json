The Electrician, Ashley, was prompt in picking up my request, we agreed a date and time.  He was punctual, polite and helpful.  His work was to a high standard, no mess, no fuss and advice on suitable lightbulbs.  He asked questions I hadn't thought about, i.E.  The \"drop\" from the ceiling (which is high) so that he could adjust the length of chain to suit MY needs.  Very good value for a job well done.  Will definitely recommend to friends and neighbours.  Thank you CheckaTrade, will use again.","createdAt":"2022-06-13T08:56:45.391Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-18T11:37:05.000Z","legacyId":"OR6lfHcPlgkw8Mw7BwKH","consumerId":"","categoryId":12,"topLevelCategoryId":12,"location":{"postcode":"OL15"},"verified":"VERIFIED","rating":{"qualityOfWorkmanship":10,"tidiness":10,"reliabilityAndTimekeeping":10,"courtesy":10,"rating":10},"publishedAt":"2022-06-13T08:58:06.000Z","name":"Renegade Electrical Ltd","uniqueName":"renegadeelectrical","mediaAttachments":[],"category":{"id":12,"label":"Electrician","name":"electrician"}}
