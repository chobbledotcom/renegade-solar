# Complaints Procedure

A complaint is when a customer tells us they are not satisfied with our products or services and wants us to address the issue.

We aim to provide a good standard of service. When customers raise concerns, we review each case and work to reach a fair resolution.

## Who Can Complain

Anyone affected by our products or services can make a complaint.

Someone else can complain on behalf of the affected person if:

- the person has died
- the person cannot make a complaint themselves, or
- the person has given permission for someone to act for them

If you do not want to complain yourself and do not have someone who can help you, we can find an independent advocate to assist you.

## How to Complain

You can make a complaint:

- in person
- by phone
- through an advocate or representative
- by letter
- by email

## Who Handles Complaints

The Managing Director is responsible for handling all complaints about our products and services.

We will provide, where reasonably possible:

- help you need to understand our complaints procedure; or
- advice on where to get that help.

## When to Complain

You should complain as soon as possible after the issue occurs or when you become aware of it. If you complain more than six months later, it may be harder to investigate. We will consider whether you had good reasons for the delay and whether we can still investigate the matter fairly.

## What We Do

1. We record the complaint details in our Complaints Log.
2. We tell the customer we will try to resolve the complaint and explain their right to take the matter further if we cannot reach an agreement (see "If We Cannot Resolve Your Complaint" below).
3. If we cannot resolve a phone complaint straight away, we ask the customer to put it in writing by email or letter so we have a clear record. We will help with this if needed.
4. We may ask the customer for documents or other information. We record what we receive in the Complaints Log.
5. If we need to inspect a solar PV system or visit the customer, we will do this within 7 days of receiving the complaint. If the customer has no heating or hot water because of the issue, we will visit within 24 hours.
6. After a visit, we tell the customer the outcome and record this in the Complaints Log.
7. We keep notes of all contact with the customer while we work to resolve the complaint, including phone calls.
8. We send the customer our findings and a summary of what we have done within 10 working days of receiving the complaint.
9. When we can, we try to resolve complaints more quickly and informally, such as with a phone call. We still record these complaints.
10. We will not take legal action against a customer without first trying to resolve the problem through this procedure and the Renewable Energy Consumer Code's dispute resolution process.
11. We review the Complaints Log regularly to see if we need to make changes to prevent similar complaints.

## If We Cannot Resolve Your Complaint

If we cannot resolve a complaint or the customer is not satisfied with what we offer, we will tell them where they can take their complaint next.

### MCS Certification Body

If the complaint is about technical parts of a solar PV system installation, we will direct the customer to our MCS installer certification body.

The MCS Helpdesk is open Monday to Friday, 9.00am to 4.30pm (closed on bank holidays).

### Renewable Energy Consumer Code (RECC)

If the complaint is about customer service parts of a solar PV system installation, we will direct the customer to the Renewable Energy Consumer Code.

Information about the RECC dispute resolution process is in the 'How to Complain' section at: [recc.org.uk/consumers/how-to-complain](https://www.recc.org.uk/consumers/how-to-complain)

**Please note:** These schemes will not usually look into a complaint until we have had a chance to try to resolve it.
