# Complaints Procedure

We define a complaint as any statement of dissatisfaction from our customers regarding our products or services that requires a response or resolution.

Our commitment is to deliver exceptional standards across everything we do. When customers raise concerns, we carefully review each case and work collaboratively to reach a resolution that is both prompt and fair, ensuring customer satisfaction throughout the process.

## Eligibility to Raise Concerns

Any individual impacted by our products or services may submit a complaint to Renegade Electrical.

Third parties may lodge complaints on behalf of the affected individual when:

- the individual has passed away
- the individual is unable to raise concerns themselves, or
- explicit permission has been granted for representation

Should you prefer not to raise concerns directly and lack a suitable representative, we can arrange for an independent advocate to support you through this process.

## How to Submit Complaints

Complaints may be submitted through the following channels:

- face-to-face discussions
- telephone calls
- via an advocate or authorised representative
- written correspondence
- electronic mail

## Accountability

Overall accountability for managing complaints about our products and services rests with the Managing Director.

We commit to providing, wherever reasonably achievable:

- assistance required to navigate our complaints procedure; or
- guidance on accessing such assistance.

## Timeframes for Submission

We recommend raising concerns promptly following the incident or when you first become aware of it. Complaints submitted beyond six months may present investigation challenges. However, we will assess whether valid reasons existed for the delay and determine if a thorough and equitable investigation remains feasible.

## Our Process

1. Upon receipt, we document all complaint details in our Complaints Log.
2. We inform customers of our commitment to finding a resolution whilst advising them of their right to escalate matters if an agreement cannot be reached (see "Escalation Options" below).
3. When telephone complaints cannot be immediately resolved, we request written submission via email or letter to ensure accurate record-keeping. We provide support with this when needed.
4. Where appropriate, we may request supporting documentation or evidence from customers. All received materials are logged systematically.
5. When inspection of solar PV installations, products, or site visits are required, we schedule these within 7 days of the complaint. For urgent matters affecting heating or hot water provision, we attend within 24 hours.
6. Following any necessary visits, we communicate outcomes promptly and update our records accordingly.
7. All correspondence and attempted communication with customers is documented throughout the resolution process, including telephone discussions.
8. We provide customers with our findings and a comprehensive summary of actions taken within 10 working days of complaint receipt.
9. Where possible, we prioritise faster, informal resolution methods, such as advisory telephone calls that address concerns directly. These are still formally recorded.
10. Legal action will not be initiated or threatened against customers without first exhausting the resolution processes outlined here and within the Renewable Energy Consumer Code's dispute framework.
11. Regular reviews of our Complaints Log inform preventative measures to reduce future occurrences.

## Escalation Options

When internal resolution proves unsuccessful or customers remain dissatisfied with proposed remedies, we provide guidance on external complaint channels.
