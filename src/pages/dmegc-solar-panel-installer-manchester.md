## Why we use DMEGC solar panels

When you're looking at solar panels, you need something that's actually going to perform in Manchester weather and last for decades. DMEGC panels tick both boxes.

I've been fitting DMEGC modules across North Manchester for a while now, and they're really quality kit. They're not the only panels I install – I also rate the Trina Vertex series – but DMEGC are consistently reliable and their warranty terms are excellent.

## What makes DMEGC panels different

DMEGC make N-type TOPCon solar modules, which is the newer technology that's gradually replacing the older P-type panels. The main difference you'll notice is better performance in low light conditions and lower degradation over time.

Their Infinity RT series panels hit 23.8% efficiency, which is genuinely impressive. That means more electricity generated from the same roof space, which matters when you've got limited south-facing area to work with.

The company's been manufacturing since 1980 and they've shipped over 60GW of panels worldwide. They're ranked as a Tier 1 manufacturer by Bloomberg and consistently get top marks in the PVEL reliability tests. That's not marketing fluff – it means their panels actually hold up in the real world.

## Warranty that actually means something

DMEGC offer a 25-year product warranty on their Infinity RT panels and a 30-year linear power warranty. Most manufacturers only offer 12 years on the product itself, so this is better coverage than you'll get from many competitors.

The linear power warranty guarantees the panels will still produce at least 88.85% of their original output after 30 years. In practice, that means your panels will still be generating decent electricity three decades from now.

## Performance in Manchester weather

Here's the thing about solar panels in Manchester – they don't need blazing sunshine to work. They generate electricity from daylight, and Manchester gets plenty of that even when it's overcast.

DMEGC's N-type technology performs better than older P-type panels in cloudy conditions and lower light levels. And the rain actually helps by keeping the panels clean, washing off dust and grime that would otherwise reduce efficiency.

I've seen DMEGC installations in Prestwich, Blackley, and across Greater Manchester consistently hit their predicted output figures. They work.

## The technical bits that matter

The Infinity RT series uses TOPCon technology – Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact. Without getting too technical, it means electrons move more efficiently through the panel, which translates to better performance and less power loss over time.

DMEGC panels also have excellent bifacial performance on some models, meaning they can capture reflected light from your roof surface. On a light-coloured roof, this can boost your generation by a few percent.

They handle temperature variations well too. Solar panels actually produce less power when they get too hot, so DMEGC's low temperature coefficient means better performance during summer heatwaves.

## Why not just use the cheapest panels?

You could save a few quid by going with bargain-basement panels, but it's a false economy. Solar panels should last 30+ years, so the extra cost of quality modules like DMEGC gets spread over decades of electricity generation.

Cheaper panels degrade faster, perform worse in our climate, and often come with inferior warranties from manufacturers who might not be around in 10 years. DMEGC are an established company with real backing – if there's ever a warranty claim, they'll still be there to honour it.

## Battery storage with DMEGC panels

DMEGC panels work brilliantly with battery storage systems. I typically pair them with Solax or AlphaESS batteries, depending on what suits your setup.

The combination means you can store excess generation during the day and use it in the evening when everyone's home and electricity is expensive. During summer, you can run your house almost entirely on solar and stored power. In winter, the panels still generate decent amounts and you can top up the battery overnight on cheap tariffs.

## Installation process

I handle every DMEGC installation personally, from the initial survey through to commissioning and grid connection. Being MCS-certified (NAP-66870) means your system qualifies for the Smart Export Guarantee, so you get paid for excess electricity you export back to the grid.

The installation itself is straightforward on most properties. I'll assess your roof during the free survey, plan the optimal layout for your available space, and handle all the paperwork including building control notifications and DNO applications.

Most residential installations take 1-2 days depending on system size. I keep disruption to a minimum and tidy up afterwards.

## What about Trina Vertex panels?

Like I said at the start, DMEGC aren't the only quality panels out there. I also fit Trina Vertex series panels, which are equally reliable and come with similar specifications.

The choice often comes down to what's available, pricing at the time, and what suits your specific roof layout. Both DMEGC and Trina manufacture excellent N-type modules that'll serve you well for decades.

I'll discuss both options during your survey and recommend what makes most sense for your property and budget.

## Areas we cover

I'm based in Prestwich and cover the whole of Greater Manchester. I've completed DMEGC installations in [Blackley](/solar-panel-installer-blackley/), [Middleton](/solar-panel-installer-middleton/), [Failsworth](/solar-panel-installer-failsworth/), [Radcliffe](/solar-panel-installer-radcliffe/), [Stockport](/solar-panel-installer-stockport/), [Altrincham](/solar-panel-installer-altrincham/), and throughout [Trafford](/solar-panel-installer-trafford/).

Being local means no call-out charges for surveys and quick response times if you ever need anything sorting after installation.
