## About Renegade Solar

My name is Ashley Merritt, owner of Renegade Solar. Based in North Manchester, I have over 15 years' experience as an electrician, including 10 years in commercial projects.

In 2016, I worked in the Channel Islands on high-end mansions and apartments, providing electrical services for:

- Loft conversions
- Kitchens
- Extensions
- Domestic and commercial properties
- Industrial sites, including the Jersey Recycling Centre

After returning to Manchester, I established Renegade Electrical in 2018.

Like most people today, I am genuinely concerned about climate change. I understand the need for renewable solutions that suit everybody's needs - whether that's a commercial business trying to cut energy costs or a family trying to save money. At Renegade Solar, we have a solution for you.

I am continually amazed at how much power these modern solar panels can generate on a rooftop in the North of England. I use quality [DMEGC](/dmegc-solar-panel-installer-manchester/) and Trina Vertex panels that perform well even in our northern climate. Together with battery storage, you will be amazed at how much money you can save!
