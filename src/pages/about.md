## About Renegade Solar

Renegade Solar is led by Ashley Merritt, based in North Manchester, with over 15 years' experience as an electrician, including 10 years in commercial projects.

In 2016, Ashley worked in the Channel Islands on high-end mansions and apartments, providing electrical services for:

- Loft conversions
- Kitchens
- Extensions
- Domestic and commercial properties
- Industrial sites, including the Jersey Recycling Centre

After returning to Manchester, Ashley established Renegade Electrical in 2018.

Like most people today, we're concerned about climate change. We understand the need for renewable solutions that suit different needs - whether that's a commercial business trying to cut energy costs or a family trying to save money. At Renegade Solar, we have solutions for you.

Modern solar panels generate substantial power even on a rooftop in the North of England. We use quality [DMEGC](/dmegc-solar-panel-installer-manchester/) and Trina Vertex panels that perform well in our northern climate. Together with battery storage, you can make significant savings on your energy bills.
