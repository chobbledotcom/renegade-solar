# Hale

Renegade Solar provides professional solar panel installations and electrical services throughout Hale. As MCS-certified installers, we deliver high-quality renewable energy solutions for homes in one of Greater Manchester's most desirable areas.

Hale's large detached properties with generous roof space are well suited to solar and battery systems. We understand the area's mix of period homes and modern executive properties, and we're familiar with the conservation area considerations around South Hale and Hale Station.

Every installation is personally overseen by Ashley Merritt, a fully qualified electrician with over 15 years of experience. When you contact us, you speak directly to an electrician who will survey your property and design your system - we don't employ salespeople.
