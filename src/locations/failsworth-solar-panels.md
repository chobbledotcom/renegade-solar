Looking for a solar panel installer in Failsworth? I'm Ashley from Renegade Solar, operating across Greater Manchester from my base in Prestwich. With a [9.61/10 Checkatrade rating](https://www.checkatrade.com/trades/renegadeelectrical/) and MCS certification, I handle solar installations on all types of properties.

## Why Choose Renegade Solar for Your Failsworth Property

I've completed installations throughout Failsworth on everything from traditional terraced houses to commercial flat-roofed buildings. The photos in our gallery show recent work in the area – proper installations with attention to detail, from scaffolding setup through to final commissioning.

As an MCS-certified installer (certification number [NAP-66870](https://mcscertified.com/find-an-installer/)), I ensure your system qualifies for the Smart Export Guarantee. Without MCS certification, you can't get paid for the electricity you export back to the grid – so this credential really matters.

## Solar Panels Work Well in Failsworth

Manchester weather doesn't stop solar panels generating electricity. In fact, rain keeps them clean by washing away dust and dirt that would otherwise reduce efficiency. Your panels will generate power all year round, with summer months covering most of your usage and winter still providing decent returns.

According to [Ofgem's latest data](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/smart-export-guarantee-annual-report-april-2023-march-2024), over £30 million was paid out last year through the Smart Export Guarantee scheme. That's real money going back to homeowners who've invested in solar.

## What Makes Renegade Solar Different

I'm NAPIT-registered (66870) for electrical safety and an Octopus Energy Trusted Partner. As a member of Green Economy's curated network, I'm committed to sustainable installations that actually work properly. I handle everything from initial survey through to grid connection paperwork and Smart Export Guarantee applications.

Being based in Prestwich means I'm just down the road from Failsworth – no travel charges, and if you ever need anything sorting, I'm nearby.

## Battery Storage for Maximum Savings

Adding battery storage to your solar installation means you can use solar power in the evening when everyone's home and demand is highest. You can also charge your battery overnight on cheap electricity if you're on a time-of-use tariff, then use that stored power during expensive peak hours.

For Failsworth households wanting to properly cut their energy bills, battery storage is the sensible choice.

## Flat Roof Installations

Got a flat-roofed extension or commercial property? I've done plenty of flat roof solar installations in Failsworth using proper mounting systems that don't compromise your roof's waterproofing. These systems work brilliantly and often give you more flexibility with panel positioning than pitched roofs.

## Ready to Cut Your Energy Bills?

With energy prices staying high, solar panels offer genuine savings for Failsworth residents. I'll give you honest advice about what'll work for your property – no pressure, no overselling, just straightforward information.
