# Bramhall

Renegade Solar provides professional solar panel installations and electrical services throughout Bramhall. Our MCS-certified team delivers high-quality renewable energy solutions tailored to Bramhall's diverse property types, from Victorian homes in the village to larger detached properties around Bramhall Park.

We understand the specific challenges of working in Bramhall - the conservation area considerations, tree shading from mature streets, and the mix of period and modern properties. Every installation is handled personally by Ashley Merritt, a fully qualified electrician with over 15 years of experience.
