Professional EV charger installations throughout Altrincham. As a NAPIT-registered installer based in nearby Prestwich, we understand the specific needs of Altrincham homeowners and provide expert charging solutions tailored to the area's diverse property types.

## Why Altrincham Residents Choose Home EV Charging

**Expensive public charging** is becoming a real issue. While there are chargers dotted around at local supermarkets and Altrincham Interchange, they're all dead expensive at 60-80p per kWh during peak times. Compare that to home charging on a smart tariff like Octopus Go at just 7.5p per kWh overnight, and you'll save a few tenners every time you charge.

**Perfect for commuting patterns** - Most Altrincham residents work in Manchester, with many using the tram or driving to Piccadilly. Having a fully charged car every morning means you can skip the expensive public chargers entirely for daily driving. Plus, if you're heading to Manchester Airport (just 15 minutes away), you'll arrive with a full battery and avoid those expensive airport charging fees.

**Slow charging works perfectly** - Your home charger won't be a supercharger like you'll find at some public spots, but that's absolutely fine because you can charge slowly overnight when the leccy is dead cheap. Who needs rapid charging when you're fast asleep anyway?

## Property Types and Charging Solutions

### Period Properties (Bowdon, Hale, Central Altrincham)

Altrincham's beautiful Victorian and Edwardian homes present unique opportunities for EV charging. Many have:

**Traditional driveways** - Perfect for wall-mounted 7kW chargers. We regularly install on Victorian villas in Hale where the existing electrical supply easily handles a modern EV charger.

**Converted properties** - Flats converted from large houses often need careful planning. We assess the existing electrical infrastructure and work with freeholders to install individual charging points or shared facilities.

**Conservation area considerations** - Properties near Altrincham town centre or in Bowdon's conservation areas need discrete installations. We specialise in neat, unobtrusive mounting that respects the architectural character.

### Modern Developments (Timperley, Broadheath, New Builds)

**New builds** - Many recent developments around Timperley and Broadheath are already EV-ready with dedicated parking and upgraded electrical supplies. We can quickly install smart chargers with minimal disruption.

**Executive homes** - Larger properties in Hale Barns and surrounding areas are ideal for faster 22kW three-phase charging, perfect for larger EVs or multiple electric vehicles.

## Local Infrastructure and Installation

**Grid infrastructure** in Altrincham is excellent, meaning installations are straightforward without supply upgrade issues common in rural areas. Most properties have the electrical capacity needed for modern EV charging, making the whole process dead simple.

## Smart Integration for Altrincham Homes

**Solar panel integration** - Altrincham's affluent areas see lots of solar installations. We can configure your EV charger to prioritise solar energy during the day, potentially charging your car for free during sunny periods.

**Time-of-use tariffs** - With Octopus Go or similar, you can charge overnight at 7.5p per kWh compared to day rates around 30p. For a typical commute to Manchester, that's under £2 for a full charge instead of £20+ at public rapids.

**Battery storage systems** - Popular in Hale and Bowdon, these can store cheap overnight electricity to charge your car during more expensive periods, or store excess solar for evening vehicle charging.

## Real Savings for Altrincham Drivers

**Daily Manchester commute** (20 mile round trip): Home charging costs under £2 vs £8-12 public charging.

**Manchester Airport trips** (30 mile round trip): £3 home charging vs £15+ public rapids.

**Weekend Peak District trips** (100+ miles): £8 home charging vs £40+ public charging en route.

Over a year, typical Altrincham residents save £1,500-2,500 versus relying on public charging.

## Installation Process for Altrincham Properties

**Survey and consultation** - We assess your property's electrical capacity, parking arrangements, and usage requirements. Many Altrincham homes have ample electrical headroom for EV charging.

**Planning considerations** - For listed buildings or conservation areas around Bowdon and central Altrincham, we handle any necessary notifications and ensure discrete, appropriate installations.

**Quick installation** - Most Altrincham installations complete in half a day with minimal disruption. We protect driveways and leave everything spotless.
