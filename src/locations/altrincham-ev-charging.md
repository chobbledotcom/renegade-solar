Professional EV charger installations throughout Altrincham. As a NAPIT-registered installer based in nearby Prestwich, we understand the specific needs of Altrincham homeowners and provide expert charging solutions tailored to the area's diverse property types.

## Why Altrincham Residents Choose Home EV Charging

**Expensive public charging** is becoming a real issue. While there are chargers dotted around at local supermarkets and Altrincham Interchange, they're all dead expensive at 60-80p per kWh during peak times. Compare that to home charging on a smart tariff like Octopus Go at just 7.5p per kWh overnight, and you'll save a few tenners every time you charge.

**Perfect for commuting patterns** - Most Altrincham residents work in Manchester, with many using the tram or driving to Piccadilly. Having a fully charged car every morning means you can skip the expensive public chargers entirely for daily driving. Plus, if you're heading to Manchester Airport (just 15 minutes away), you'll arrive with a full battery and avoid those expensive airport charging fees.

**Slow charging works perfectly** - Your home charger won't be a supercharger like you'll find at some public spots, but that's absolutely fine because you can charge slowly overnight when the leccy is dead cheap. Who needs rapid charging when you're fast asleep anyway?

## Property Types and Charging Solutions

### Period Properties (Bowdon, Hale, Central Altrincham)

Altrincham's beautiful Victorian and Edwardian homes present unique opportunities for EV charging. Many have:

**Traditional driveways** - Perfect for wall-mounted 7kW chargers. We regularly install on Victorian villas in Hale where the existing electrical supply easily handles a modern EV charger.

**Converted properties** - Flats converted from large houses often need careful planning. We assess the existing electrical infrastructure and work with freeholders to install individual charging points or shared facilities.

**Conservation area considerations** - Properties near Altrincham town centre or in Bowdon's conservation areas need discrete installations. We specialise in neat, unobtrusive mounting that respects the architectural character.

### Modern Developments (Timperley, Broadheath, New Builds)

**New builds** - Many recent developments around Timperley and Broadheath are already EV-ready with dedicated parking and upgraded electrical supplies. We can quickly install smart chargers with minimal disruption.

**Executive homes** - Larger properties in Hale Barns and surrounding areas are ideal for faster 22kW three-phase charging, perfect for larger EVs or multiple electric vehicles.

## Local Infrastructure and Installation

**Grid infrastructure** in Altrincham is excellent, meaning installations are straightforward without supply upgrade issues common in rural areas. Most properties have the electrical capacity needed for modern EV charging, making the whole process dead simple.

## Why a 7kW Charger Matters

Granny chargers that plug into a normal socket take forever - all day to charge your car, which means you're stuck paying daytime electricity rates. A proper 7kW wall charger gets it done overnight during the cheap window. On Octopus Go that's 7.5p per kWh compared to 30-60p at public chargers.

Altrincham's got good motorway access (M56, M60, M6), so rapid chargers for long trips are easy to find. But for commuting to Manchester or running around locally, home charging is miles cheaper. Plus with the government banning new petrol and diesel cars in 2030, we're all heading electric anyway.

## Equipment We Install

Already running **Solax** or **AlphaESS** solar panels or home batteries? Their EV chargers integrate well with their kit. We fit those regularly for people who want everything talking to each other.

We're also an **Octopus Energy Trusted Partner**, which means we install any of the [Octopus chargers](https://octopus.energy/get-an-ev-charger/). These are smart - they wait for the cheapest electricity rates before charging your car. You just plug in when you get home, the charger handles the timing.

Or if you've already bought a specific charger, that works too. Order what you want and we'll fit it.

## Installation Process

The chargers are all weatherproof, so mounting outside is no issue. Garage wall, house wall, wherever suits your parking. If we need to run cable from your consumer unit across the property, we use heavy duty armoured cable designed for outdoor installation.

Jobs are done in a day. Minimal mess. Your consumer unit needs to be up to current standards - if you've had solar or battery work done, it will be. Even without solar, you can still get a time-of-use tariff for cheap overnight car charging.

## Real Savings for Altrincham Drivers

**Daily Manchester commute** (20 mile round trip): Home charging costs under £2 vs £8-12 public charging.

**Manchester Airport trips** (30 mile round trip): £3 home charging vs £15+ public rapids.

**Weekend Peak District trips** (100+ miles): £8 home charging vs £40+ public charging en route.

Over a year, typical Altrincham residents save £1,500-2,500 versus relying on public charging.

## Installation Process for Altrincham Properties

**Survey and consultation** - We assess your property's electrical capacity, parking arrangements, and usage requirements. Many Altrincham homes have ample electrical headroom for EV charging.

**Planning considerations** - For listed buildings or conservation areas around Bowdon and central Altrincham, we handle any necessary notifications and ensure discrete, appropriate installations.

**Quick installation** - Most Altrincham installations complete in half a day with minimal disruption. We protect driveways and leave everything spotless.
