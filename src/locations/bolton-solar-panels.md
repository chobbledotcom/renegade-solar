[Renegade Solar](/about/) provides expert [solar panel and battery installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) throughout Bolton. As an [MCS-certified installer](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) based in North Manchester, we bring our expertise directly to Bolton homeowners and businesses looking to reduce energy bills and carbon footprints.

We've successfully installed solar systems on a wide variety of Bolton properties - from traditional terraced houses to larger detached homes and commercial buildings. Each installation is personally handled by [Ashley Merritt](/about/), a fully qualified electrician with over 15 years of experience who understands the unique characteristics of Bolton's diverse housing stock.

## Solar Performance in Bolton

Many Bolton residents ask us if solar panels are effective in Greater Manchester's changeable weather. The answer is a resounding yes! Modern solar panels work efficiently even on cloudy days, generating at 80%+ of their capacity without direct sunlight.

Bolton's position well connected to the motorway network makes us ideally placed to serve the area efficiently, and we've completed numerous installations across the borough.

## Property Types in Bolton

Bolton is the UK's largest town with around 280,000 residents, and its housing reflects its rich industrial heritage. Terraced and semi-detached properties make up 70% of Bolton's housing stock - a legacy of the town's mill worker cottages from when over 200 cotton mills operated here.

We frequently work with Bolton's characteristic terraced properties in areas like Farnworth (average property price £168k), Great Lever, and Deane, where careful system design maximises generation within available roof space. For larger homes in Bolton's premium postcodes like Belmont, Bromley Cross, and Egerton (average £282k), we can design more substantial systems.

Bolton's industrial heritage means the town has excellent commercial opportunities. With substantial warehouses and manufacturing facilities across the borough, plus a growing logistics sector, Bolton's business community can benefit enormously from [commercial solar installations](/services/commercial-solar-installations/) with their generous roof space and high daytime energy consumption.

For properties where conventional solar installation isn't suitable (due to shading, orientation, or planning restrictions), we offer [battery-only solutions](/services/home-battery-installations/) that work brilliantly with time-of-use tariffs like [Octopus Energy's](https://octopus.energy/tariffs/).

## Local Knowledge & Personal Service

What sets us apart from national installers is our personal approach. Ashley personally handles every aspect of your installation - from initial survey through design and installation to final commissioning. There are no salespeople, no call centres, and no subcontractors.

Our local knowledge means we understand Bolton's planning requirements and have experience with the specific property types across the borough. We can typically complete most installations within a week with minimal disruption.
