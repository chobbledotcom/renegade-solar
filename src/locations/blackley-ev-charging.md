Expert EV charger installations throughout Blackley. As your local NAPIT-registered installer, we provide professional charging solutions for electric cars tailored to your property and driving needs.

## Local EV Charging Service

Based nearby in Prestwich, we serve the Blackley area with comprehensive EV charger installation services. Our local knowledge ensures installations that work perfectly with your home's electrical system.

## Our Charger Range

We're experienced installers of **Solax** and **AlphaESS** EV chargers, both excellent options that integrate seamlessly with their respective solar and battery systems. As an **Octopus Energy Trusted Partner**, we also install the full range of Octopus chargers from their [EV charger programme](https://octopus.energy/get-an-ev-charger/), which offer smart time-of-use features that automatically charge your car when electricity is cheapest.

If you've already got a specific charger in mind from another manufacturer, we're happy to install whatever works best for you – just order it and we'll get it fitted professionally.

## Smart Charging Technology

We install the latest smart EV chargers that integrate seamlessly with solar panels and home battery systems, allowing you to maximise your renewable energy investment. The Octopus chargers are particularly clever – they can automatically charge your electric vehicle during the cheapest overnight periods (as little as 7.5p per kWh on tariffs like Octopus Go, compared to 30-60p+ at public chargers), making running an electric car incredibly affordable without you having to remember to plug in at specific times.
