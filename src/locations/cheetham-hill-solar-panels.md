Looking for a solar panel installer in Cheetham Hill? I'm Ashley from Renegade Solar, based just down the road in Prestwich. With a 9.61/10 Checkatrade rating and MCS certification (NAP-66870), I provide honest advice and quality installations that actually save you money.

## Why Cheetham Hill Residents Choose Renegade Solar

One Prestwich customer saved thousands when I gave them a second opinion: "Another electrician convinced us we needed a whole house rewire. After inspecting, Ashley let us know it was fully unnecessary and we just needed a new fuse board. He saved us thousands of pounds with that first visit."

That's the difference with Renegade Solar. I won't sell you something you don't need. With over 15 years' experience as an electrician, I'll give you straight advice about whether solar makes sense for your property.

## Solar Works Well in Cheetham Hill

Your Victorian terrace, semi-detached house, or modern property can all benefit from solar panels. Even with Manchester weather, solar panels generate excellent returns. Rain actually helps by keeping panels clean, and according to [Ofgem's latest data](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/smart-export-guarantee-annual-report-april-2023-march-2024), over Â£30 million was paid out last year through the Smart Export Guarantee.

As an MCS-certified installer, I ensure you qualify for these government payments. Without MCS certification, you can't access the [Smart Export Guarantee](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-and-social-schemes/smart-export-guarantee-seg), so this credential really matters.

## What Makes Renegade Solar Different

I'm NAPIT-registered (66870) for electrical safety and an Octopus Energy Trusted Partner. But what really sets me apart is how I work with customers. As one review says: "Ashley was friendly, knowledgeable and did a great job. During the job he found an earthing fault from previous work and fixed this small job at no extra cost."

I handle everything from survey to commissioning, including all the paperwork for grid connection and Smart Export Guarantee applications. Being based in Prestwich means I'm just minutes away from Cheetham Hill, with no travel charges added to your quote.

## Battery Storage Maximises Your Savings

Adding battery storage means you can use solar power in the evening when everyone's home. Store cheap overnight electricity if you're on a time-of-use tariff. It's perfect for Cheetham Hill's family households who want to cut their energy bills properly.

## Ready to Cut Your Energy Bills?

With energy prices staying high, solar panels with battery storage offer real savings for Cheetham Hill residents. I'll give you honest advice about what works for your property, with no pressure and no overselling.
