# Hale Barns

Renegade Solar provides professional solar panel installations and electrical services throughout Hale Barns. As MCS-certified installers, we deliver high-quality renewable energy solutions suited to the area's substantial properties.

Hale Barns is home to some of Greater Manchester's largest residential properties, with generous roof space and higher energy consumption than typical homes. These properties are ideal candidates for solar and battery systems that can make a real difference to energy bills.

Every installation is personally overseen by Ashley Merritt, a fully qualified electrician with over 15 years of experience. When you contact us, you speak directly to an electrician who will survey your property and design your system - we don't employ salespeople.
