Looking for a solar installer in Crumpsall? I'm Ashley from Renegade Solar, based just down the road in Prestwich. With MCS certification (NAP-66870) and a 9.61/10 Checkatrade rating from 80+ reviews, I provide honest advice and quality installations.

## Why Crumpsall Residents Trust Renegade Solar

One customer said: "Ashley did an excellent job installing solar panels on my roof and batteries. As someone who likes everything perfect, I can say he did it exactly how I would have done it. I highly recommend him."

That's the level of care I bring to every Crumpsall installation. With over 15 years as an electrician, I won't oversell or push unnecessary extras. I'll tell you straight whether solar makes sense for your property.

## Perfect for Crumpsall Properties

Your semi-detached house, Victorian terrace near the hospital, or bungalow can all benefit from solar. Crumpsall gets the same sunshine hours as the rest of England, and rain actually helps by keeping panels clean.

Last year, the [Smart Export Guarantee](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-and-social-schemes/smart-export-guarantee-seg) paid out over Â£30 million to solar owners. As an MCS-certified installer, I ensure you qualify for these payments - without MCS certification, you can't access them.

## Honest Advice, Fair Prices

Here's what sets me apart: I saved one customer thousands by telling them they didn't need a full rewire, just a new fuse board. Another review: "Ashley gave some good advice but didn't try to upsell - genuinely felt like he was telling me for my own benefit, not his."

I'm NAPIT-registered for safety and an Octopus Energy Trusted Partner. But more importantly, I'm local - just minutes from Crumpsall with no travel charges.

## Battery Storage Cuts Bills Further

Adding batteries lets you store solar power for evening use or cheap overnight electricity for the day. Perfect for Crumpsall's working families who want proper energy savings.

From nearby Blackley: "Very professional and efficient, really helpful, will definitely use for future electrical work."
