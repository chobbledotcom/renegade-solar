From our Prestwich base just down the road, Renegade Solar provides solar panel installations to Crumpsall. With over 18,000 residents and 6,000 households, Crumpsall's established residential areas work well for renewable energy generation.

To earn money from solar panels through the [Smart Export Guarantee](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-and-social-schemes/smart-export-guarantee-seg), you need an installation and installer certified through the Microgeneration Certification Scheme. We're MCS-certified, which means you can access these payments. You'll also need a meter that provides half-hourly readings, which most smart meters do. Energy suppliers set their own tariff rates, which must be above zero, and you apply directly to them for payments.

Crumpsall's housing suits solar installations well. Semi-detached houses around Crumpsall Lane typically have spacious roofs with good orientation. Victorian terraces near the hospital might have smaller roofs but still generate worthwhile amounts of electricity. Newer developments often have modern electrical systems ready for solar. Bungalows offer easy roof access and simple roof structures that make installation straightforward.

With 56.4% of Crumpsall households being single family homes, many properties have the roof space needed for effective solar installations. The 64.9% of households experiencing deprivation in one or more dimensions makes reducing energy bills particularly important. Solar panels with battery storage can cut electricity costs significantly, providing long-term financial relief.

Manchester weather doesn't prevent solar panels working effectively. Rain washes away dust and dirt that reduces efficiency, actually helping panel performance. Crumpsall gets similar annual sunshine hours to most of England. According to [Ofgem's latest annual report](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/smart-export-guarantee-annual-report-april-2023-march-2024), solar PV made up 99.98% of Smart Export Guarantee registrations, with most installations between 4kW and 10kW, perfect for typical homes.

Crumpsall's diverse population brings different perspectives on renewable energy. With 57.1% of residents born in the UK and 42.9% arriving from elsewhere, many have experienced solar technology in various climates. The significant populations from Europe (67.4% of all residents) and the Middle East and Asia (25.4%) often come from countries where solar is already common.

Battery storage enhances solar installations by storing excess energy generated during the day for evening use. This suits the 56.4% of single family households who typically have higher evening energy consumption. Smaller households, making up 31.9% of Crumpsall, benefit from scaled solutions matching their lower energy needs. The 11.7% of other household types, often extended families, can use larger arrays with substantial battery storage.

Being based in Prestwich means we understand Crumpsall properties. We know the electrical setups in post-war semis, how to work with Victorian property constraints, local planning considerations, and the best approaches for different roof types. Our proximity means no expensive travel charges and quick response times.

Semi-detached properties offer excellent roof space with straightforward installations. Victorian terraces have smaller roofs but we maximise generation from compact spaces. Modern developments often have solar-ready infrastructure, making installations quicker and more cost-effective. Bungalows, popular with older residents, provide easy access and simple roof structures.

With 86.4% of coupled residents being married or in civil partnerships, many Crumpsall households make long-term financial plans where solar makes sense. Typical payback periods are six to eight years, with 25-year manufacturer warranties on panels. The Smart Export Guarantee provides potential income from excess energy sold to the grid. For the 98.7% of residents living in households rather than communal establishments, controlling energy costs through solar provides security.

We cover all of Crumpsall including Crumpsall Lane and surrounding streets, areas near North Manchester General Hospital, properties around Crumpsall Park, homes near Heaton Park, and borders with Blackley and Cheetham Hill. Our Prestwich base means we're minutes away from any Crumpsall property.

According to [Ofgem's SEG Year 4 data](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/smart-export-guarantee-annual-report-april-2023-march-2024), the Smart Export Guarantee scheme saw over Â£30 million paid to registered installations, with 283.1 GWh of low-carbon electricity exported. As MCS-certified installers (certification number [NAP-66870](https://mcscertified.com/find-an-installer/)), we ensure your installation qualifies for these payments. The MCS certifies and quality assures microgeneration installations, and without this certification, you can't access the Smart Export Guarantee.

Our [9.61/10 Checkatrade rating](https://www.checkatrade.com/trades/renegadeelectrical/reviews) reflects years of quality installations in North Manchester. We handle everything from initial survey through to commissioning, including grid connection paperwork and Smart Export Guarantee applications.
