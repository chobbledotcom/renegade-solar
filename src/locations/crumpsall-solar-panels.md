## Ideal Properties for Solar in Crumpsall

Crumpsall's housing stock is perfectly suited for solar installations. Whether you're in one of the traditional semi-detached houses around Crumpsall Lane, the Victorian terraces near the hospital, or newer developments, we've successfully installed solar systems on properties just like yours.

We regularly work with:

- Semi-detached houses with spacious roofs
- Victorian and Edwardian terraced properties

## Why Crumpsall Residents Choose Solar

The numbers speak for themselves - with 64.9% of Crumpsall households experiencing deprivation in one or more dimensions, reducing energy bills is a priority for many residents. Solar panels with battery storage can slash electricity costs by up to 70%, providing long-term financial relief.

Don't let Manchester weather put you off - rain actually helps solar panels by washing away dust and dirt that can reduce efficiency. Even on cloudy days, modern panels generate significant power. Plus, Crumpsall gets the same annual sunshine hours as most of England, making solar a smart investment.

**Smaller households** - With 31.9% being one-person households, we offer scaled solutions that match lower energy needs whilst still providing excellent returns on investment.

**Multi-generational homes** - The 11.7% of other household types often include extended families with higher energy demands. Larger solar arrays with substantial battery storage can meet these needs effectively.
