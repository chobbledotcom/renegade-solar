# Commercial Solar for Whitefield Businesses

If your Whitefield business is spending hundreds or thousands monthly on electricity, [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/) could slash those costs to near zero. We're based locally in [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/) and regularly work in Whitefield, providing the same responsive service and honest advice that's earned us our strong reputation.

## Whitefield business types ideal for solar

**Retail units** - Shops along Bury New Road and Whitefield town centre with flat or pitched roofs see excellent returns from commercial solar. High daytime consumption means you're using generated energy immediately rather than storing it.

**Manufacturing and industrial** - Whitefield's industrial estates house factories and manufacturing facilities with heavy machinery consumption. Higher electricity usage means faster payback - typically 3-4 years for commercial installations.

**Food and hospitality** - Cafes, restaurants, bakeries running commercial kitchens and refrigeration benefit enormously. One nearby Prestwich bakery spends £10,000 monthly - we can help businesses facing similar costs.

**Offices and warehouses** - Commercial properties with large flat roofs are perfect. Panels can be mounted to point south regardless of building orientation, generating substantial energy throughout the day.

## Real-world example from nearby

Horwich Interior Designs & Carpets (Bolton) spends £700 monthly on electricity. Our 50-panel flat roof design brings that to zero with three-year payback. A second option with 115 panels covering flat and pitched roofs has four-year payback. Both eliminate electricity costs and provide 20+ years of free energy afterward.

## Why commercial solar works in Whitefield

Commercial electricity prices have soared - many businesses face bills that have doubled or tripled. For Whitefield businesses on tight margins, reducing monthly costs by 70-100% can be transformative. Solar provides immediate savings, protection from future price rises, and income from excess electricity sold back to the grid through Smart Export Guarantee.

## Flat and pitched roofs

Flat roofs are brilliant for commercial solar - panels mount to point south regardless of building orientation. Pitched roofs on larger properties offer excellent potential too. We provide multiple design options (flat only, pitched only, or combined) with detailed financial analysis for each.

## Staff EV charging

If you have spare land or outdoor space, ground-mounted solar can power [EV charging points](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) for staff vehicles. We've installed systems offering free staff charging powered entirely by solar - valuable employee benefit at zero ongoing cost.

## Local service, expert installation

Being based nearby means we understand local properties and respond quickly to enquiries. As an [MCS-certified](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) installer and [Octopus Energy Trusted Partner](/accreditations/octopus-trusted-partner/), we provide quality installations with honest advice - if solar doesn't make financial sense, we'll tell you.
