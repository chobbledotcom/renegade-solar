Professional EV charger installations throughout Stockport, including Bramhall, Marple Bridge and surrounding areas. NAPIT-registered service with smart charging technology for electric cars.

## Stockport EV Charging Solutions

We provide expert EV charger installations across the Stockport area, working with all property types from traditional homes to modern developments.

## Our Charger Range

We're experienced installers of **Solax** and **AlphaESS** EV chargers, both excellent options that integrate seamlessly with their respective solar and battery systems. As an **Octopus Energy Trusted Partner**, we also install the full range of Octopus chargers from their [EV charger programme](https://octopus.energy/get-an-ev-charger/), which offer smart time-of-use features that automatically charge your car when electricity is cheapest.

If you've already got a specific charger in mind from another manufacturer, we're happy to install whatever works best for you – just order it and we'll get it fitted professionally.

## Advanced Integration

Our smart EV chargers can be integrated with solar panels and home battery systems, allowing you to charge your electric car using clean, renewable energy at minimal cost. The Octopus chargers are particularly clever – they can automatically charge your vehicle during the cheapest overnight periods (as little as 7.5p per kWh on tariffs like Octopus Go, compared to 30-60p+ at public chargers), making running an electric vehicle incredibly affordable without you having to remember to plug in at specific times.
