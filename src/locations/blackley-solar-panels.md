## Why Blackley Homes Benefit From Solar Power

Many Blackley properties are ideal for [solar and battery installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) - both traditional terraced homes as well as more modern housing developments. Our team has plenty of experience working with:

- Victorian terraces with slate roofs
- Post-war semi-detached houses
- New-build developments with tile roofs
- Flat-roofed properties, eg commercial buildings

You might think that the constant Manchester rain means solar panels aren't viable, but the opposite is actually the case. Rain doesn't affect panel efficiency to any appreciable degree - it's all about the hours of sunshine, and in Manchester we get just as much of that as down south! And even better - the rain keeps the panels clean, removing dust and dirt build-up which blocks the sun's rays.

We've found most homes in the M9 and M25 postcode areas can achieve excellent energy savings, even with north-facing roofs. We'll help you plan your panels to ensure the maximum possible efficiency regardless of your roof's orientation.

And if you're just after a [battery installation](/services/home-battery-installations/), that's fine too - you can still save money on your electricity bills by storing electricity overnight when it's cheap and using it during the day. [Click here to search Octopus Energy's website for your Blackley postcode](https://octopus.energy/tariffs/) to learn about the difference between peak and off-peak prices - it can be as little as 1/3rd the price overnight!
