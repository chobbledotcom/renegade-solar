Professional EV charger installations throughout Bolton for homes and businesses. NAPIT-registered service with smart charging technology, supporting Bolton's growing electric vehicle infrastructure.

## Bolton's Electric Vehicle Revolution

Bolton Council has committed Â£2.3M to roll out at least 400 electric vehicle charging points across the borough by 2028. This ambitious programme prioritises high-density residential areas and underserved neighbourhoods, with 150 charging points planned for installation in the first phase alone (2025-2026).

With Bolton currently having fewer than 80 public charge points, this expansion represents a transformative shift in the town's electric vehicle infrastructure. As Bolton works towards its net-zero carbon target by 2038, home and workplace charging becomes essential for the thousands of residents making the switch to electric vehicles.

## EV Solutions for Bolton Properties

Bolton's housing landscape is dominated by terraced and semi-detached properties, which together make up 70% of the town's homes. We provide expert EV charger installations across all Bolton property types, from traditional Victorian terraces in areas like Farnworth and Great Lever to modern developments in Horwich and Lostock.

For Bolton's many terraced properties where off-street parking may be limited, we can advise on the best charging solutions and work within any planning requirements. The council's focus on high-density residential areas means public charging is expanding, but home charging remains the most convenient and cost-effective option where possible.

For businesses across Bolton's growing economy, workplace charging is becoming essential. With the University of Bolton targeting 20,000 students and Bolton's manufacturing, logistics, and professional services sectors expanding, staff increasingly need workplace charging facilities.

## Smart Charging Integration

Our smart EV chargers can be integrated with [solar panels](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) and [home battery systems](/services/home-battery-installations/), allowing you to charge your vehicle using clean, renewable energy at minimal cost. This is particularly valuable for Bolton's industrial and commercial properties with suitable roof space.
