# EICR Electrical Safety Inspections in Blackley

Professional electrical safety inspections throughout Blackley from experienced NAPIT-registered electricians. £150 for all domestic properties - same day certificates with no waiting around.

## Blackley's Established Housing Areas

Blackley has a solid mix of properties, from traditional terraced houses and council-built homes to modern developments in the surrounding areas. Each type brings its own electrical considerations that need proper professional assessment.

**Traditional properties** throughout Blackley often have electrical systems that have grown and changed over many years. Original installations put in for basic lighting and minimal electrical use have been extended to cope with modern family life - washing machines, electric showers, tumble dryers, and all the electrical items families depend on today.

**Council-built properties and modern developments** around Blackley should be more straightforward, but even these can have issues. Research shows that 1 in 5 properties can have electrical installation problems, often from maintenance issues or modifications over the years.

## Our Blackley EICR Service - £150 All Properties

**£150 for any domestic property in Blackley** - whether you're in a compact terrace, council property, or larger family home, the price doesn't change.

We provide same day certificates and can usually fit you in quickly. EICR inspections are easier to schedule around other electrical work, so we can often help with short notice requests.

## For Blackley Landlords

Blackley's rental market serves local families and working people, so landlords need to maintain proper electrical safety standards. **EICR every 5 years plus one for each new tenant** - that's what the law requires.

Penalties for not having proper electrical certificates are serious - fines up to £30,000, plus local councils can arrange expensive remedial work and bill you for it. Give existing tenants the report within 28 days, new tenants get it before they move in.

**Blackley's mix of property ages and types** means you might be dealing with anything from older terraced houses to council-built properties to modern family homes, each with different electrical setups and potential issues.

## For Blackley Property Buyers

**Get an EICR before any money changes hands.** Blackley properties are important investments for local families, so you want to know about any electrical problems before you commit.

If we find issues like an old fuse box or dodgy wiring (more likely in older Blackley properties), you can use this information to negotiate on price or decide whether to proceed with the purchase.

Much better to find out about a potential electrical upgrade during your house purchase than discover it after you've moved in and settled.

## Blackley Property Characteristics

**Older terraced houses** (common throughout established Blackley areas) often have:

- Electrical systems that have been upgraded bit by bit over time
- Old-style consumer units that don't meet current safety standards
- Not enough electrical circuits for modern household needs
- Earthing systems that need bringing up to current requirements

**Council-built and modern properties** in Blackley can still have challenges:

- Installation quality that depends on maintenance and any modifications over the years
- Electrical work that might meet basic requirements but could be improved
- RCD protection that doesn't fully meet current best practices
- Problems with earth bonding in bathrooms and kitchens

## Thorough Electrical Testing

**Complete visual inspection** of all electrical installations you can see - wiring, switches, sockets, and your consumer unit. We check for damage, signs of overheating, and general condition.

**Technical testing** with proper calibrated equipment. This includes continuity testing, insulation resistance measurement, earth fault loop impedance testing, and checking your RCDs actually work when they're supposed to.

**Same day paperwork** - you get your EICR certificate and a detailed report explaining any problems we find, written in language that makes sense.

## Local Knowledge

We work regularly throughout Blackley and know the common electrical issues in different types of properties and areas. Whether you're dealing with an older house that's been well looked after or want to check the electrical condition of a property you're considering, local experience helps.

Blackley's mix of property types and ages means electrical setups can be quite different even within the same area. Knowing what's normal and what needs attention comes from experience working in the local community.

## When We Find Problems

**Straight talking without sales pressure.** If we find electrical issues, we'll explain clearly what's wrong, why it matters, and what your options are. You get honest prices for any work that needs doing, without inflated costs or unnecessary extras.

We can sort out any electrical problems we find during the inspection. No need to find other electricians and start again - we'll schedule the work within a month.
