Expert EV charger installations throughout Trafford. NAPIT-registered service providing smart charging solutions for electric cars with renewable energy integration capabilities.

## Trafford EV Charging Service

We serve the entire Trafford area with professional EV charger installations, from Altrincham to Sale and beyond. Our expertise covers all property types and electrical configurations.

## Our Charger Range

We're experienced installers of **Solax** and **AlphaESS** EV chargers, both excellent options that integrate seamlessly with their respective solar and battery systems. As an **Octopus Energy Trusted Partner**, we also install the full range of Octopus chargers from their [EV charger programme](https://octopus.energy/get-an-ev-charger/), which offer smart time-of-use features that automatically charge your car when electricity is cheapest.

If you've already got a specific charger in mind from another manufacturer, we're happy to install whatever works best for you – just order it and we'll get it fitted professionally.

## Smart Charging Technology

Install advanced EV chargers that integrate with solar panels, home batteries, and smart tariffs to minimise charging costs while maximising the use of renewable energy. The Octopus chargers are particularly clever – they can automatically charge your electric vehicle during the cheapest overnight periods (as little as 7.5p per kWh on tariffs like Octopus Go, compared to 30-60p+ at public chargers), making running an electric car incredibly affordable without you having to remember to plug in at specific times.
