Based in nearby Prestwich, we're perfectly positioned to serve homeowners across Bury with solar panel and battery installations. Whether you're in the town centre grabbing black pudding from the market or out in the suburbs, we can get to you quickly via the motorway or straight up Bury Old Road.

## Why Bury Homes Are Perfect for Solar

Bury's mix of property types makes it ideal for [solar and battery installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/). We regularly work with traditional Victorian houses throughout the town, 1960s semi-detached properties in the suburbs, modern new-build developments, and commercial properties with flat roofs. Each property type has its own character, but they all love generating free electricity.

## Solar as a Long-Term Investment

With the cost of living crisis hitting everyone's pockets, solar panels represent a smart long-term investment for Bury homeowners. While the upfront cost might seem significant, the savings add up over time. Most systems pay for themselves within 8-10 years, then continue generating free electricity for decades. That's a better return than most investments, and certainly more reliable than backing the right horse at the races.

With energy prices continuing to rise, locking in your own electricity generation makes real financial sense. Plus, if you add a [battery storage system](/services/home-battery-installations/), you can store excess power during the day and use it in the evening when electricity costs more. It's like having your own personal power station, but without the cooling towers.

## Manchester Weather Isn't a Problem

Despite what people think about Manchester weather, solar panels work brilliantly here. They generate electricity from daylight, not just sunshine, and actually perform better in our cooler temperatures. That regular drizzle keeps your panels clean and operating at peak efficiency, much like how it keeps Bury Market's famous black pudding stalls looking fresh.

We've installed systems across Bury that consistently exceed expectations, even on north-facing roofs. Our experience with local properties means we know how to maximise your system's performance regardless of your roof's orientation.

## Local Knowledge, Personal Service

Being based in Prestwich means we understand Bury properties inside and out. We know how to work with older electrical systems in period homes, navigate planning considerations for different areas, understand typical energy usage patterns in local homes, and recommend the best battery solutions for your specific needs.

## Coverage Areas

We serve all areas of Bury including the town centre, Ramsbottom, Tottington, Whitefield, Radcliffe, Ainsworth, Summerseat, and Walmersley. Basically, if you can get there from Bury Market, we can get there too.
