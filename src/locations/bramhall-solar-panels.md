[Renegade Solar](/about/) provides [solar panel and battery installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) throughout Bramhall, from the Victorian terraces near the village to the large detached properties around Bramhall Park. As an [MCS-certified installer](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) based in North Manchester, we understand the specific challenges and opportunities that Bramhall properties present for solar installations.

We work regularly in Bramhall and know the area well - the mix of period properties, the tree-lined streets, and where the conservation area restrictions apply. Every installation is handled personally by [Ashley Merritt](/about/), a fully qualified electrician with over 15 years of experience.

## Bramhall Property Types and Solar Suitability

Bramhall's housing stock is quite different from other parts of Stockport, and that affects how we approach solar installations:

**Victorian and Edwardian Homes** - Common around Bramhall village and the older parts of the area. These often have slate roofs with decent south-facing aspects. The roof structure is usually solid, though we sometimes need to work around original features. Many of these properties have good roof space and can accommodate 10-12 panels without issue.

**Larger Detached Properties** - Bramhall has plenty of substantial family homes with generous roof areas. These are ideal for solar - we can often fit 12-16 panels, sometimes more, which makes a real difference to energy bills on larger properties with higher consumption.

**Tree Coverage Considerations** - Many Bramhall streets are heavily treed, which is lovely but can cause shading issues. We'll assess actual shading patterns at your property rather than give generic advice. Sometimes a smaller system on an unshaded section works better than a larger system partially shaded. We're honest about what'll work and what won't.

**Conservation Area Properties** - Parts of Bramhall village fall within conservation areas. This doesn't mean you can't have solar panels, but it does mean we need to consider visibility from the street and may need planning permission for certain installations. We've navigated this before and can advise on what's realistic for your property.

## Solar Performance in Bramhall

Bramhall sits at a slightly higher elevation than central Manchester, which generally means better solar exposure. The area does well for solar generation, even with Manchester's changeable weather - modern panels work efficiently on cloudy days, generating at 80%+ capacity without direct sunlight.

The main factor affecting performance in Bramhall is tree shading rather than weather. Mature trees are common here, and we'll do a proper shading analysis as part of the survey to work out realistic generation figures for your specific location.

## System Sizing for Bramhall Properties

Most Bramhall properties are suited to 4-6kW systems (10-15 panels). Larger homes often benefit from 6-8kW systems to match higher energy consumption. We size systems based on your actual usage and roof characteristics, not just by maximising panel count.

For properties with [EV chargers](/solar-panel-installer-stockport/#ev-charging), we typically recommend larger systems (6kW+) and a battery to make best use of the solar generation for vehicle charging.

## Battery Storage and Time-of-Use Tariffs

Many Bramhall customers combine solar with battery storage, particularly those on time-of-use tariffs like [Octopus Energy's](https://octopus.energy/tariffs/) Intelligent Octopus or Go. The battery charges from cheap overnight electricity and solar generation during the day, then powers the house during peak rate periods.

For properties where roof-mounted solar isn't suitable - due to shading, orientation, or planning restrictions - we offer [battery-only solutions](/services/home-battery-installations/) that work brilliantly with time-of-use tariffs.

## What Our Customers Say

We maintain a **9.6/10 rating** on Checkatrade based on feedback from customers across Greater Manchester. Our customers consistently mention our honesty about what'll actually work for their property, the quality of workmanship, and the fact that Ashley handles everything personally - no salespeople or subcontractors.

Check out our [customer reviews](/reviews/) to see what people think.

## Planning and Installation Process

Most Bramhall installations don't require planning permission unless you're in a conservation area or have a listed building. We handle all the technical aspects:

- DNO (electricity network) notifications
- MCS certification for SEG payments
- Building regulations compliance
- System design and documentation

Installation typically takes 1-2 days with minimal disruption. We're tidy, respectful of your property, and leave everything properly finished.
