# EICR Electrical Safety Inspections in Crumpsall

Need an EICR in Crumpsall? I'm Ashley from Renegade Solar, just down the road in Prestwich. £150 flat rate, same day certificate, no hidden charges. NAPIT-registered with 20+ years' experience and a 9.61/10 Checkatrade rating.

## £150 All-In - Guaranteed

Semi-detached, Victorian terrace, bungalow, or flat - it's £150. No VAT surprises, no travel charges, no "extras" discovered halfway through. Just £150 for complete peace of mind.

"Ashley was super responsive and did an amazing job, will definitely use his services again in the future."

## Crumpsall Landlords - Stay Legal

[The law](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/312/contents/made) demands an EICR every five years. Penalties go up to £30,000. I'll have you compliant within days of calling.

Same-day certificates mean no waiting. If I find C1 or C2 issues, I'll explain clearly and quote fairly for fixes. No scaremongering, just facts.

## Buying in Crumpsall?

Get an EICR before completing. Crumpsall's mix of post-war semis, Victorian terraces, and newer builds all have their quirks. Find problems before purchase, not after.

"Ashley gave good advice re future electrical checking but didn't try to upsell - genuinely felt like he was telling me for my own benefit, not his."

## I Know Crumpsall Properties

Post-war semis often have deteriorating wiring. Victorian terraces near the hospital have mixed-era electrics. Even new builds can have corners cut. I've inspected them all.

If repairs are needed, I handle everything. Consumer unit upgrades, RCD protection, proper earthing - all at fair prices with no pressure.

## Why Choose Me?

Minutes away in Prestwich means quick response, no travel charges. My Checkatrade reviews tell the story - professional, honest, reliable.

From Blackley: "Absolutely fantastic work carried out by Ashley. Very reliable and friendly, would highly recommend."
