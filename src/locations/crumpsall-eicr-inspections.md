# EICR Electrical Safety Inspections in Crumpsall

Need an EICR in Crumpsall? Based just down the road in Prestwich, we provide professional electrical safety inspections for £150 - same day certificates guaranteed. As NAPIT-registered electricians with 20+ years experience, we know Crumpsall properties inside out.

## Why Crumpsall Properties Need Regular EICRs

Crumpsall's 6,020 households span everything from Victorian terraces to modern builds, each with unique electrical challenges. The older properties around Crumpsall Lane and near the hospital often have electrical systems that have evolved over decades, whilst newer developments can have their own issues from rushed construction.

**Common issues we find in Crumpsall properties:**

- Mixed-era wiring in older homes
- Outdated fuse boxes without RCD protection
- DIY modifications that don't meet regulations
- Overloaded circuits from modern appliance demands
- Deteriorating cables in post-war properties

Even newer properties need checking - statistics show 1 in 5 new builds have electrical defects. With Crumpsall's mix of property ages, regular inspections are essential for safety.

## Our Crumpsall EICR Service - £150 Fixed Price

## For Crumpsall Landlords

**It's the law:** EICRs every 5 years plus one for each new tenancy. With Crumpsall's active rental market, compliance is crucial.

Non-compliance penalties reach £30,000. You must give existing tenants the report within 28 days, new tenants before they move in. Any C1 (danger present), C2 (potentially dangerous), or FI (further investigation) codes must be resolved within 28 days.

With 31.9% of Crumpsall households being single-person occupancies and many properties being rentals, electrical safety compliance protects both tenants and landlords.

## For Crumpsall Property Buyers

**Always get an EICR before completing.** Crumpsall's varied housing stock means electrical standards vary wildly between properties.

Common discoveries include outdated consumer units needing £400-600 upgrades, amateur electrical work requiring correction, and insufficient circuits for modern living. Finding these issues before purchase lets you negotiate price reductions or request repairs.

## Understanding Crumpsall's Property Types

**Semi-detached houses** (56.4% of Crumpsall homes are single family households) often have:

- Post-war wiring that may be deteriorating
- Consumer units in understairs cupboards or garages
- Extensions with questionable electrical work
- Adequate capacity but outdated safety features

**Victorian/Edwardian terraces** typically feature:

- Electrical systems modified multiple times
- Mix of cable types from different eras
- Limited circuits leading to overloading
- Earth bonding that doesn't meet current standards

**Modern developments** can have:

- Corners cut during construction
- Cheap components prone to early failure
- Incorrect circuit protection
- Missing or inadequate earth bonding

**Converted properties** - Larger houses converted to flats sometimes have:

- Electrical work done without proper certification
- Shared supplies causing complications
- Inadequate separation between dwellings
- Overloaded original infrastructure
