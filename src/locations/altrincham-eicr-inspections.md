# EICR Electrical Safety Inspections in Altrincham

Professional electrical safety inspections in Altrincham from NAPIT-registered electricians. £150 for all domestic properties with same day certificates - no matter whether you're in a Georgian townhouse or a modern apartment.

## Altrincham's Diverse Property Portfolio

Altrincham's got everything from beautiful Georgian and Victorian properties around the town centre to sleek modern developments and converted apartments. Each type brings its own electrical challenges, and that's where local knowledge really counts.

**Period properties around Altrincham town centre** often have electrical systems that have evolved over decades. Original installations designed for basic lighting have been stretched to cope with modern demands - electric showers, washing machines, tumble dryers, and all the gadgets we rely on today.

**Modern developments and conversions** might seem like they'd be problem-free, but research shows 1 in 5 new builds still have electrical faults. Poor workmanship during rushed construction phases can create issues that only show up during proper testing.

## Our Altrincham EICR Service - £150 All Properties

**Fixed price of £150 for any domestic property in Altrincham** - whether you're in a compact conversion flat or a substantial family home, the price doesn't change.

We provide same day certificates and can usually fit you in quickly. EICR inspections are easier to schedule than major electrical work, so we can often accommodate requests at short notice.

## For Altrincham Landlords

With Altrincham's strong rental market, landlords need to stay on top of electrical safety compliance. **EICR every 5 years plus one for each new tenant** - it's not optional.

Penalties for non-compliance are serious - fines up to £30,000, plus local authorities can arrange costly remedial work and bill you for it. Give existing tenants the report within 28 days, new tenants before they move in.

**Altrincham's mix of property types** means you might be dealing with anything from a converted Victorian villa split into flats to a modern purpose-built development. Each presents different electrical considerations.

## For Altrincham Property Buyers

**Get an EICR before any money changes hands.** Altrincham's property prices mean electrical problems can be expensive surprises you don't want.

If we find issues like an outdated consumer unit or inadequate earthing (common in older Altrincham properties), you can negotiate repair costs off the purchase price. Much better than discovering you need a £4,000 rewiring job after completion.

Even solicitors recommend electrical inspections because they know how much remedial work can cost in Altrincham's property market.

## Understanding Altrincham's Electrical Challenges

**Period properties** (common around the town centre and near the market) often have:

- Electrical systems upgraded piecemeal over many years
- Consumer units that don't meet current safety standards
- Inadequate circuits for modern electrical loads
- Earthing arrangements that need updating

**Modern developments and conversions** can have their own issues:

- Installation shortcuts from competitive building phases
- Loose connections that weren't properly tightened
- Missing earth bonding in bathrooms and kitchens
- RCD arrangements that don't fully comply with current regulations

## Comprehensive EICR Testing

**Visual inspection** covers all visible wiring, switches, sockets, and your consumer unit. We check for damage, signs of overheating, and general condition.

**Detailed electrical testing** using calibrated equipment includes continuity testing, insulation resistance measurement, earth fault loop impedance testing, and RCD operation checks. This is proper technical assessment, not just a quick visual check.

**Same day certification** - you get your EICR certificate and comprehensive report explaining any findings in terms that make sense.

## Local Expertise in Altrincham

We understand Altrincham's property market and the electrical issues common to different areas. Whether you're dealing with a converted property where original features have been preserved, or a new build where modern standards should apply, local experience helps identify what to look for.

The mix of property ages and types in Altrincham means electrical systems vary enormously. What's appropriate for a 1930s semi isn't the same as what you'd expect in a 2020s apartment conversion.

## When We Find Issues

**No pressure, just clear explanations.** If we discover problems, we explain what's wrong, why it matters, and what needs doing. You get honest quotes for any remedial work without inflated prices or unnecessary extras.

We can handle any electrical issues discovered during inspection. Why complicate things by involving multiple contractors? Remedial work gets scheduled within a month.
