Need an EV charger installed in Cheetham Hill? I'm Ashley from Renegade Solar, your local NAPIT-registered electrician based in nearby Prestwich. As an Octopus Energy Trusted Partner with a 9.61/10 Checkatrade rating, I'll get your home charging sorted properly.

## Save Thousands on Charging Costs

Public charging at Manchester Fort costs 30-60p per kWh. Home charging on Octopus Go costs just 7.5p overnight. That daily commute into Manchester costs under £2 at home versus over £10 at public chargers. Over a year, Cheetham Hill families save £1,500-2,000 by charging at home.

The [government's EV grant](https://www.gov.uk/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grant-household) covers up to £350 off installation costs. I'm OZEV-approved and handle all the paperwork, making the process straightforward.

## Cheetham Hill Properties? No Problem

Whether you've got a Victorian terrace, semi-detached with a drive, or a flat with allocated parking, I'll find a solution that works. I've installed chargers using rear access points, cable runs to front parking, and worked with property management for shared facilities.

One customer said: "Ashley fitted an EV charger for me and provided lots of brilliant advice. His advice even allowed me to keep costs down and his prices were the best quotes I had."

## Smart Integration with Solar

Got solar panels already? I'll configure your charger to use free solar energy during the day. Perfect if you work from home. I ensure everything works together properly, as this review shows: "Ashley ensured our new GivEnergy charger was properly integrated with the solar and battery system. He found an earthing fault from previous work and fixed this small job at no extra cost."

## Why Choose Renegade Solar?

I'm based minutes away in Prestwich, so no travel charges or waiting around. I'll give you honest advice about the best charger for your needs and budget. Most installations complete in half a day, and I handle everything including any electrical upgrades needed.

As one Blackley customer put it: "Ashley got in touch quickly and was patient when I wasn't available initially. Talked it through, came and sized it up and completed the job within days. Would recommend highly."

## Ready to Start Saving?

Stop paying a fortune at public chargers. With home charging, you'll wake up to a fully charged car every morning at a fraction of the cost.
