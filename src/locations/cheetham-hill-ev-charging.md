Operating from nearby Prestwich, Renegade Solar provides expert EV charger installations throughout Cheetham Hill. As your local NAPIT-registered installer and Octopus Energy Trusted Partner, we understand the specific challenges and opportunities for EV charging in this bustling North Manchester neighbourhood.

## Why Cheetham Hill Residents Need Home Charging

**Public charging is expensive and inconvenient** - While there are some public chargers at the Manchester Fort Shopping Park and scattered around the area, relying on them for daily charging is costly and time-consuming. Public rapid chargers can cost 30-60p per kWh, while home charging on an Octopus Go tariff costs just 7.5p overnight - that's up to 8 times cheaper!

**Perfect for Manchester commutes** - Whether you're heading into the city centre via Cheetham Hill Road, taking the A56 to Salford, or joining the M60, starting each day with a fully charged vehicle means never worrying about finding a public charger. Your daily commute could cost less than £2 with home charging versus £10+ at public chargers.

**Overnight charging works brilliantly** - Your home charger doesn't need to be a rapid charger. Slow, steady charging overnight when electricity is cheapest is perfect for most drivers. You're asleep, the car's parked - why not wake up to a full battery every morning?

## Cheetham Hill Property Solutions

**Victorian terraces** dominate much of Cheetham Hill, particularly in the older residential areas. With nearly 7,000 households in the area, many are traditional terraces with limited parking. We've successfully installed chargers for terraced houses using creative solutions - from rear yard installations with cable runs to front parking areas, to working with residents who have consistent street parking spots nearby.

**Post-war developments** around the area often have driveways or designated parking, making installations more straightforward. These properties typically have electrical systems that can handle 7kW charging without major upgrades, keeping installation costs reasonable.

**Flats and apartments** - With 27.1% of Cheetham Hill households being single-person residences, many residents live in flats. We work with property management companies and landlords to install shared charging facilities or individual chargers where parking is allocated.

**Commercial properties** along Cheetham Hill Road and surrounding business areas benefit from workplace charging installations. With many residents working locally, workplace charging can be an excellent alternative to home charging.

## Smart Integration for Urban Living

Many Cheetham Hill properties already have solar panels, and we configure EV chargers to prioritise free solar energy during daylight hours. This is perfect for residents who work from home or have flexible schedules - charge your car with sunshine while you work!

For the majority who charge overnight, time-of-use tariffs like Octopus Go offer electricity at 7.5p per kWh from 12:30-4:30am. That means:

- A typical Manchester city centre commute (10-mile round trip) costs just £1
- Shopping trips to Manchester Fort (5-mile round trip) cost 50p
- Weekend trips to the Trafford Centre (25-mile round trip) cost £2.50
- Visiting family in Blackpool (120-mile round trip) costs £9

Compare that to petrol costs or public charging, and the savings are massive - typical Cheetham Hill families save £1,200-2,000 annually by charging at home.

## Working with Cheetham Hill's Infrastructure

The area's good electrical infrastructure means most properties can accommodate EV charging without expensive upgrades. However, older Victorian properties sometimes need consumer unit upgrades to meet current safety standards - something we handle as part of our comprehensive service.

With 87.5% of Cheetham Hill residents having lived at the same address for at least a year, investing in home charging infrastructure makes perfect sense for long-term residents looking to future-proof their homes.

## Installation Expertise for Every Property Type

**Victorian terraces** - We've mastered the art of installing chargers for terraced properties, whether that's mounting on rear walls, running cables to front parking areas, or finding creative solutions for properties without off-street parking.

**Properties with driveways** - Standard wall-mounted installations that are completed quickly and neatly, usually within half a day.

**Flats with parking** - We work with building management to install chargers that can be linked to individual electricity supplies or set up with payment systems for shared use.

**Businesses** - Complete workplace charging solutions including multiple charge points, load management systems, and payment integration for staff or customer use.
