Need an EV charger installed in Cheetham Hill? I'm Ashley from Renegade Solar, your local NAPIT-registered electrician based in nearby Prestwich. As an Octopus Energy Trusted Partner with a [9.61/10 Checkatrade rating](https://www.checkatrade.com/trades/renegadeelectrical/), I'll get your home charging sorted properly.

## Save Thousands on Charging Costs

Public charging at Manchester Fort costs 30-60p per kWh. Home charging on Octopus Go costs just 7.5p overnight. That daily commute into Manchester? Under £2 at home versus over £10 at public chargers. Over a year, you'll save £1,500-2,000 by charging at home.

The [government's EV grant](https://www.gov.uk/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grant-household) covers up to £350 off installation costs. I'm OZEV-approved and handle all the paperwork, making the process straightforward.

## Cheetham Hill Properties? No Problem

Whether you've got a Victorian terrace, semi-detached with a drive, or a flat with allocated parking, I'll find a solution that works. I've installed chargers using rear access points, cable runs to front parking, and I've worked with property management for shared facilities. I'll always be clear about what's being done and where the cabling needs to go.

## Smart Integration with Solar

Got solar panels already? I'll configure your charger to use free solar energy during the day – perfect if you work from home. I ensure everything works together properly, so you're getting the most from your renewable energy setup.

## Why Choose Renegade Solar?

I'm based minutes away in Prestwich, so there's no travel charges or waiting around. I'll give you honest advice about the best charger for your needs and budget. Most installations complete in half a day, and I handle everything – including any electrical upgrades you might need. One Blackley customer had their charger installed within days of first contact – that's the quick turnaround you can expect.

## Ready to Start Saving?

Stop paying a fortune at public chargers. With home charging, you'll wake up to a fully charged car every morning – and it'll cost you a fraction of what you're paying now.
