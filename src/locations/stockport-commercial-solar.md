# Commercial Solar for Stockport Businesses

Stockport businesses facing high electricity costs can benefit from [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/) with typical payback in just 3-4 years. We're based in [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/) and regularly serve Stockport with the same professional service and honest advice that's earned us our strong reputation across Greater Manchester.

## Stockport commercial properties perfect for solar

**Manufacturing and industrial units** - Stockport's industrial estates house businesses with heavy machinery consumption. Higher electricity usage delivers faster payback - one nearby example reduced £700 monthly bills to zero with three-year payback.

**Retail and town centre shops** - Stockport town centre and retail parks with large roofs see excellent returns from commercial solar. High daytime consumption means you're using generated energy immediately rather than storing it.

**Hotels and hospitality** - Stockport's hotels, restaurants, and hospitality businesses running kitchens, heating, and facilities benefit from solar's rapid payback and long-term cost savings.

**Offices and commercial buildings** - Commercial properties with large flat roofs are ideal. Panels can be mounted to point south regardless of building orientation, generating substantial energy throughout the day.

**Cold storage and warehousing** - Temperature-controlled storage and distribution facilities with high electricity consumption see strong returns from commercial solar installations.

## Real example from Bolton

Horwich Interior Designs & Carpets spends £700 monthly on electricity. We designed two options:
- **50+ panels (flat roof only):** Brings bills to zero, three-year payback
- **115 panels (flat + pitched):** Brings bills to zero, four-year payback

Both eliminate electricity costs and provide 20+ years of free energy after payback while selling excess back to the grid through Smart Export Guarantee.

## Why Stockport businesses are investing in solar

Commercial electricity prices have soared - many Stockport businesses face bills that have doubled or tripled. Reducing monthly costs by 70-100% can be transformative for business viability. Solar provides immediate savings, protection from future price rises, and tangible environmental credentials increasingly valued by customers, stakeholders, and net-zero targets.

## Flat and pitched roof installations

Flat roofs are brilliant for commercial solar - panels mount to point south regardless of building orientation. Stockport's commercial properties often have large unused flat roof space that could be generating thousands in annual savings. Pitched roofs on larger properties offer excellent potential too. We provide multiple design options with detailed financial analysis for each approach.

## Ground-mounted solar and EV charging

If you have spare land, grass verges, or outdoor space, ground-mounted solar supplements rooftop installations or powers [EV charging points](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) for staff vehicles. We've installed ground-mounted systems offering free staff charging powered entirely by solar - valuable employee benefit at zero ongoing cost.

## MCS-certified installation

As an [MCS-certified](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) installer and [Octopus Energy Trusted Partner](/accreditations/octopus-trusted-partner/), we provide quality installations with comprehensive service from design through commissioning and aftercare. We handle grid connection, certifications, and Smart Export Guarantee setup for selling excess electricity.

## Requirements

You must own the building (not leased), have sufficient roof space or land, and ideally high electricity consumption for best returns. We provide honest advice - if solar doesn't make financial sense for your Stockport business, we'll tell you.
