# Commercial Solar for Prestwich Businesses

Based right here in Prestwich, we've seen firsthand how soaring electricity costs are hitting local businesses. One Prestwich bakery we spoke to - Slattery's - is spending £10,000 monthly on electricity and nearly went under because of it. If your business is facing crippling energy bills, [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/) could bring those costs down to near zero with payback in just 3-4 years.

## Prestwich business types perfect for solar

**Bakeries and food businesses** - Like Slattery's, many Prestwich bakeries and cafes run commercial ovens, refrigeration, and equipment that consume massive amounts of electricity. Solar installations can slash those costs while future-proofing against further price rises.

**Retail outlets** - Shops along Bury New Road and Prestwich Village with flat or pitched roofs are ideal candidates. Retail units with high daytime consumption see excellent returns from solar.

**Hotels and hospitality** - Prestwich hotels, B&Bs, and hospitality businesses running kitchens, heating, and guest facilities benefit from commercial solar's rapid payback.

**Offices and warehouses** - Commercial properties with large flat roofs can mount solar panels pointing south regardless of building orientation, generating substantial daytime energy exactly when businesses need it most.

## Real local example

We're working with Horwich Interior Designs & Carpets (just down the road in Bolton) - they spend £700 monthly on electricity. Our flat roof design with 50+ panels brings that to zero with three-year payback. We also designed a 115-panel option covering both flat and pitched roofs. After payback, it's 20+ years of free electricity while selling excess back to the grid.

## Why flat roofs work brilliantly

Flat roofs are perfect for commercial solar because panels can be mounted to point south regardless of building orientation. Many Prestwich commercial properties have unused flat roof space that could be generating thousands in savings annually.

## Local service, honest advice

Being based in Prestwich means we understand local properties and can respond quickly to commercial enquiries.

- Sufficient roof space or land
- High electricity consumption (better returns)
- Long-term ownership plans
