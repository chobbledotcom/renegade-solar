Expert EV charger installations throughout Radcliffe. As a NAPIT-registered installer and Octopus Energy Trusted Partner, we provide professional charging solutions for electric cars tailored to your property and driving needs.

## Radcliffe EV Charging Service

Based nearby in Prestwich, we serve Radcliffe with comprehensive EV charger installation services. Our local knowledge ensures installations that work perfectly with your home's electrical system and energy requirements.

## Our Charger Range

We're experienced installers of **Solax** and **AlphaESS** EV chargers, both excellent options that integrate seamlessly with their respective solar and battery systems. As an **Octopus Energy Trusted Partner**, we also install the full range of Octopus chargers from their [EV charger programme](https://octopus.energy/get-an-ev-charger/), which offer smart time-of-use features that automatically charge your car when electricity is cheapest.

If you've already got a specific charger in mind from another manufacturer, we're happy to install whatever works best for you – just order it and we'll get it fitted professionally.

## Smart Charging Technology

We install advanced EV chargers that integrate seamlessly with solar panels and home battery systems, allowing you to charge your electric vehicle using renewable energy at minimal cost. The Octopus chargers are particularly clever – they can automatically charge your car during the cheapest overnight periods (as little as 7.5p per kWh on tariffs like Octopus Go, compared to 30-60p+ at public chargers), making running an electric vehicle incredibly affordable without you having to remember to plug in at specific times.

## Customer Experience

> "Ashley fitted an EV charger for me and provided lots of brilliant advice prior to doing so, as I was clueless on the whole thing. His advice even allowed me to keep costs down and his prices were the best quotes I had, with nothing reduced on the quality of his work."
