Expert EV charger installations throughout Radcliffe. As a NAPIT-registered installer and Octopus Energy Trusted Partner, we provide professional charging solutions for electric cars tailored to your property and driving needs.

## Radcliffe EV Charging Service

Based nearby in Prestwich, we serve Radcliffe with comprehensive EV charger installation services. Our local knowledge ensures installations that work perfectly with your home's electrical system and energy requirements.

## Installation Speed and Process

We get charger installs done in a day. The units are weatherproof so they can go outside - garage wall, house wall, wherever suits where you park. If cable needs to run from your consumer unit round to the charger, we use heavy duty armoured cable designed for outdoor use.

Mess is kept to a minimum. Consumer unit needs to be up to current standards - if you've had solar panels or a battery installed, it will be. Even if you haven't got renewable kit, you can still get on a cheap overnight electricity tariff for car charging.

## Chargers Available

Running **Solax** or **AlphaESS** solar panels or batteries? We fit their EV chargers - they work well with their own systems.

As an **Octopus Energy Trusted Partner**, we also install any of the [Octopus chargers](https://octopus.energy/get-an-ev-charger/). Smart units that charge automatically when rates are cheapest. On Octopus Go that's 7.5p per kWh overnight versus 30-60p you'd pay at a public charger.

Got a charger in mind already? Order it and we'll fit it.

## Why Home Charging

The government's banning new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Radcliffe's got access to motorways (M60, M66), so rapid chargers for longer trips are around. But for day-to-day driving, home charging at 7.5p per kWh beats public charging hands down.

A proper 7kW charger tops your car up overnight during cheap rate periods. Granny chargers that plug into normal sockets take forever - all day - which means you're charging during expensive daytime electricity. Not ideal.

## Customer Experience

> "Ashley fitted an EV charger for me and provided lots of brilliant advice prior to doing so, as I was clueless on the whole thing. His advice even allowed me to keep costs down and his prices were the best quotes I had, with nothing reduced on the quality of his work."
