# EICR Electrical Safety Inspections in Cheetham Hill

We provide EICR electrical safety inspections in Cheetham Hill for £150, with same day certificates. Based in nearby Prestwich, we're NAPIT-registered electricians with over 20 years experience.

Since June 2020, the [Electrical Safety Standards in the Private Rented Sector Regulations](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/312/contents/made) require landlords to have electrical installations inspected and tested every five years by a qualified person. According to [government guidance for landlords](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electrical-safety-standards-in-the-private-rented-sector-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities), landlords must provide the report to tenants within 28 days of the inspection, to new tenants before they move in, and to the local authority within seven days if requested. Penalties for non-compliance can reach £30,000.

Cheetham Hill has nearly 7,000 households ranging from Victorian terraces to modern developments. The older properties along Cheetham Hill Road often have electrical systems modified multiple times over the decades. We regularly find wiring from different eras mixed together, consumer units without RCD protection, overloaded circuits from modern appliance demands, amateur electrical work that doesn't meet regulations, and inadequate earthing on older installations.

Research shows one in five new builds have electrical defects from rushed installation or poor workmanship. Even newer Cheetham Hill properties need proper inspection to verify electrical safety.

Our £150 price covers any domestic property in Cheetham Hill, whether it's a compact Victorian terrace or a modern apartment. The inspection covers all fixed electrical installations including wiring, sockets, switches, light fittings, and your consumer unit. We check for overloading, potential shock risks, defective electrical work, and lack of earthing or bonding.

For landlords, the regulations are clear. You need an EICR every five years and one for each new tenancy. If the report shows C1 (danger present) or C2 (potentially dangerous) codes, you must complete remedial work within 28 days and provide written confirmation to the tenant and local authority. With 27.1% of Cheetham Hill households being single-person occupancies and many properties being rentals, compliance is essential.

Property buyers should always get an EICR before completing a purchase. Common findings in Cheetham Hill include outdated fuse boxes in Victorian terraces, DIY electrical work needing correction, and insufficient circuits for modern living. It's better to negotiate repair costs upfront than discover expensive problems after moving in.

Victorian terraces in older parts of Cheetham Hill typically have electrical systems upgraded piecemeal over generations, with original cables still in use alongside modern wiring. Consumer units are often in awkward locations, and insufficient sockets lead to overuse of extension leads. Post-war properties may have aluminium wiring or early plastic-sheathed cables that are deteriorating. These frequently need consumer unit upgrades to meet current standards.

Modern developments can have installation issues like incorrectly rated circuit breakers, missing earth bonding, or poor-quality components used to cut costs. Many larger properties have been converted into flats, and these conversions sometimes have electrical work that wasn't properly certified.

Our inspection includes comprehensive visual examination of all accessible electrical components and technical testing including earth continuity, insulation resistance, polarity checks, and RCD operation. We use calibrated professional equipment to verify your installation meets British Standards. Your certificate and report explain any issues clearly, without electrical jargon.

Being local to Cheetham Hill means we understand the property types and common issues. We know what to look for in Victorian terraces versus modern flats and where previous electricians might have cut corners. There are no travel charges inflating your costs, and we can respond quickly to inspection requests.

If we find problems, we explain what's wrong and why it needs fixing, with fair quotes for necessary work. Common remedial work includes consumer unit upgrades in older properties, additional RCD protection, replacement of damaged sockets and switches, and proper earthing installation. We handle all remedial work ourselves.

We cover all of Cheetham Hill including properties along Cheetham Hill Road, areas around Abraham Moss, homes near Broughton Park, the Manchester Fort vicinity, and border areas with Crumpsall and Blackley. With 87.5% of residents having lived at the same address for a year or more, most Cheetham Hill residents are invested in their properties' long-term safety.

The diverse population means 48.7% of residents were born outside the UK. We're experienced at explaining technical issues clearly and simply, and can arrange translation if needed. Our £150 price includes everything with no hidden extras, travel charges, or certificate fees.
