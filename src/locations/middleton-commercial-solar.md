# Commercial Solar for Middleton Businesses

Middleton's commercial and industrial businesses can dramatically reduce electricity costs with [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/). We serve Middleton from our [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/) base with local, responsive service and honest advice backed by proven commercial installations.

## Middleton businesses ideal for commercial solar

**Industrial estates and manufacturing** - Middleton's industrial areas house factories and manufacturing facilities with heavy machinery consumption. High electricity usage means excellent returns - typically 3-4 year payback for commercial installations.

**Retail parks and shops** - Middleton's retail outlets with large flat or pitched roofs are perfect candidates. A nearby Bolton carpet shop reduced £700 monthly bills to zero with three-year payback using flat roof solar.

**Food and hospitality** - Cafes, bakeries, restaurants, and pubs running commercial kitchens and refrigeration benefit enormously from commercial solar's rapid payback.

**Warehousing and logistics** - Distribution centres and storage facilities with large flat roofs generate substantial daytime energy exactly when businesses need it most.

## Real numbers from Greater Manchester

**Horwich Interior Designs & Carpets** (Bolton) - £700/month electricity, large flat roof. Our 50-panel design brings bills to zero with three-year payback. Alternative 115-panel option covering flat + pitched roofs has four-year payback. Both eliminate electricity costs and provide 20+ years of free energy afterward.

**Slattery's bakery** (Prestwich) - £10,000/month electricity, nearly went under because of it. Commercial solar could eliminate most of that cost.

## Why commercial solar makes sense now

Commercial electricity prices have soared - many Middleton businesses face bills that have doubled or tripled. Reducing monthly costs by 70-100% transforms business viability and provides protection from future price rises. Solar installations also demonstrate environmental commitment increasingly valued by customers and business partners.

## Flat roofs are brilliant

Flat roofs let us mount panels pointing south regardless of building orientation. Middleton's industrial and commercial properties often have large flat roofs generating zero value - we turn those into profit centres producing decades of savings.

## Ground-mounted options for staff EV charging

If you have spare land or outdoor space, ground-mounted solar can power [EV charging points](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) for staff vehicles. We've installed systems offering free staff charging powered entirely by solar - valuable employee benefit at zero ongoing cost while demonstrating environmental leadership.

## Requirements

To qualify for commercial solar:
- You must own the building (not leased)
- Sufficient roof space or land
- High electricity consumption (better returns)
- Long-term ownership plans

We provide honest assessments - if solar doesn't make financial sense for your Middleton business, we'll tell you. As an [MCS-certified](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) installer and [Octopus Energy Trusted Partner](/accreditations/octopus-trusted-partner/), we deliver quality installations that provide the savings we promise.
