# Commercial Solar for Crumpsall Businesses

Crumpsall businesses facing high electricity costs can benefit from [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/) with payback in just 3-4 years. We're based locally in [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/) and regularly serve Crumpsall with responsive, professional service.

## Crumpsall commercial properties ideal for solar

**Industrial units** - Crumpsall's industrial estates house businesses with high electricity consumption. Factories running machinery see excellent returns - one nearby carpet shop reduced £700 monthly bills to zero with flat roof solar.

**Retail and hospitality** - Shops, cafes, and restaurants along Crumpsall Lane benefit from commercial solar's rapid payback. Daytime consumption means you're using generated energy immediately.

**Healthcare and care facilities** - Medical centres and care homes running 24/7 with high consumption see strong returns from solar combined with [battery storage](/services/home-battery-installations/).

**Warehousing and storage** - Cold storage facilities and warehouses with large roofs are perfect for commercial solar. One local example: ground-mounted solar powering [EV charging](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) for staff.

## Real numbers from nearby Bolton

Horwich Interior Designs & Carpets spends £700 monthly on electricity. Our designs:
- 50+ panels (flat roof only): Zero bills, three-year payback
- 115 panels (flat + pitched): Zero bills, four-year payback

Both options eliminate costs and provide 20+ years of free electricity after payback while selling excess back to the grid.

## Why now

Commercial electricity prices have soared - many businesses face doubled or tripled bills. Reducing £700-£10,000 monthly costs to near zero transforms business viability. Solar provides immediate savings, protection from future price rises, and demonstrates environmental commitment increasingly valued by customers.

## Flat roofs work brilliantly

Flat roofs let us mount panels pointing south regardless of building orientation. Crumpsall's commercial properties often have large flat roofs generating zero value - we turn those into decades of savings.

## Requirements

You must own the building (not leased), have sufficient roof space or land, and ideally high electricity consumption for best returns. We provide honest advice - if solar doesn't make financial sense for your business, we'll tell you.
