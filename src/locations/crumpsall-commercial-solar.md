# Commercial Solar for Crumpsall Businesses

Crumpsall businesses facing high electricity costs can benefit from [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/) with payback in just 3-4 years. We're based locally in [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/) and regularly serve Crumpsall with responsive, professional service backed by proven commercial installations.

The economics work particularly well for commercial properties because businesses consume electricity during the day when solar generation is at its peak. Unlike [domestic installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) where evening consumption requires [battery storage](/services/home-battery-installations/), commercial properties use energy as it's generated. This means you're using nearly every kilowatt-hour your panels produce, which dramatically improves the return on investment.

## Crumpsall commercial properties that see strong returns

Crumpsall's industrial estates house businesses with high electricity consumption - factories running machinery see excellent returns from commercial solar. We're currently working with a carpet warehouse in [Bolton](/services/commercial-solar-installations/bolton/) that reduced £700 monthly bills to zero with flat roof solar and three-year payback. Shops, cafes, and restaurants along Crumpsall Lane benefit from commercial solar's rapid payback because daytime consumption means you're using generated energy immediately.

Healthcare facilities including medical centres and care homes running equipment and heating around the clock see strong returns from solar, particularly when combined with [battery storage](/services/home-battery-installations/) to maximise usage of generated energy. Cold storage facilities and warehouses with large roofs are perfect for commercial solar - we've also installed ground-mounted systems powering [EV charging](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) for staff vehicles as a valuable employee benefit.

## Real numbers from nearby Bolton

We designed a system for a carpet and interior design warehouse spending £700 monthly on electricity. Two options: 50+ panels covering just the flat roof brings bills to zero with three-year payback, or 115 panels covering both flat and pitched roofs with four-year payback. Both eliminate electricity costs and provide 20+ years of free energy after payback while selling excess back to the grid through Smart Export Guarantee.

## Why flat roofs work brilliantly

Flat roofs let us mount panels pointing south regardless of building orientation, which is why Crumpsall's commercial properties with large flat roofs are ideal candidates. Many businesses have extensive flat roof space generating zero value - we can turn that into decades of savings. Even properties with pitched roofs work well, particularly larger buildings with extensive roof areas.

Commercial electricity prices have soared in recent years - many Crumpsall businesses face bills that have doubled or tripled. Reducing £700-£10,000 monthly costs to near zero can transform business viability while providing protection from future price rises and demonstrating environmental commitment increasingly valued by customers.

## Requirements and our approach

You must own the building (not leased), have sufficient roof space or land, and ideally high electricity consumption for best returns. As an [MCS-certified](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) installer and [Octopus Energy Trusted Partner](/accreditations/octopus-trusted-partner/), we provide honest advice - if solar doesn't make financial sense for your business, we'll tell you. We also handle all [electrical certifications](/services/electrical-testing/) and grid connection requirements so you can earn income from excess generation.
