# Commercial Solar for Bury Businesses

Bury businesses spending hundreds or thousands monthly on electricity can slash those costs with [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/). We're based nearby in [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/) and serve Bury with local, responsive service backed by [MCS certification](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) and proven commercial experience delivering genuine savings.

Commercial properties benefit more from solar than domestic ones because businesses consume electricity during the day when solar generation is at its peak. Unlike [domestic installations](/services/solar-and-battery-installations/) where evening consumption requires [battery storage](/services/home-battery-installations/), commercial properties use energy as it's generated. You're using nearly every kilowatt-hour your panels produce, which dramatically improves the financial returns and shortens payback periods to typically 3-4 years.

## Bury businesses that see the best returns

Bury's industrial heritage means numerous factories with heavy machinery consumption still operate across the area. High electricity usage from production equipment delivers faster payback for commercial solar installations. Food businesses including bakeries, cafes, restaurants, and food manufacturing with commercial kitchens and refrigeration see excellent returns - one [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/) baker spending £10,000 monthly nearly went under because of rising electricity costs.

Bury town centre shops and retail parks with large roofs are ideal candidates because daytime consumption aligns perfectly with solar generation. We're currently working with a carpet warehouse in [Bolton](/commercial-solar-installations-bolton/) that reduced £700 monthly bills to zero with three-year payback. Hotels, B&Bs, and hospitality businesses running kitchens, heating, and facilities throughout the day benefit from commercial solar's rapid payback and long-term savings. Cold storage facilities and distribution centres with large flat roofs generate substantial solar energy exactly when businesses need it most.

## Real example from Bolton

We designed a system for a carpet and interior design warehouse spending £700 monthly on electricity. Two options: flat roof only with 50+ panels brings bills to zero with three-year payback, or flat plus pitched roofs with 115 panels has four-year payback and maximum generation. After payback, they're looking at 20+ years of free electricity while selling excess back to the grid through Smart Export Guarantee.

## Why flat and pitched roofs both work well

Flat roofs give us flexibility that pitched roofs don't - we can mount panels to point south regardless of building orientation. This is why retail units, warehouses, and commercial properties with large flat roofs are perfect candidates. Pitched roofs on factories, hotels, or larger commercial buildings offer excellent potential too. We provide multiple design options with detailed financial analysis for each so you can make an informed decision about which approach delivers the best return for your business.

If you have spare land or grass verges, ground-mounted solar supplements rooftop installations or powers [EV charging points](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) for staff vehicles. We've installed systems offering free staff charging powered entirely by solar - valuable employee benefit at zero ongoing electricity cost.

## Our approach to Bury businesses

Commercial electricity prices have soared in recent years - many Bury businesses face bills that have doubled or tripled. For businesses on tight margins, reducing monthly costs by 70-100% can be transformative while providing protection from future price rises and demonstrating tangible environmental credentials increasingly valued by customers and stakeholders.

You must own the building (not leased), have sufficient roof space or land, and ideally high electricity consumption for best returns. We assess your property and usage, then create detailed designs showing energy generation, cost savings, and payback period based on actual consumption patterns. As an [MCS-certified](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) installer and [Octopus Energy Trusted Partner](/accreditations/octopus-trusted-partner/), we provide honest advice - if the numbers don't work, we'll tell you. We also handle all [electrical certifications](/services/electrical-testing/) and grid connection requirements.
