# Commercial Solar for Bury Businesses

Bury businesses spending hundreds or thousands monthly on electricity can slash those costs with [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/). We're based nearby in [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/) and serve Bury with local, responsive service backed by [MCS certification](/accreditations/mcs-certified/) and proven commercial experience.

## Bury business types perfect for solar

**Manufacturing and factories** - Bury's industrial heritage means numerous factories with heavy machinery consumption. High electricity usage delivers faster payback - typically 3-4 years for commercial installations.

**Food businesses** - Bakeries, cafes, restaurants, and food manufacturing with commercial kitchens and refrigeration see excellent returns. One Prestwich bakery spends £10,000 monthly - we can help Bury businesses facing similar costs.

**Retail outlets** - Bury town centre shops and retail parks with large roofs are ideal candidates. A Bolton carpet shop we're working with reduced £700 monthly bills to zero with three-year payback.

**Hotels and hospitality** - Bury hotels, B&Bs, and hospitality businesses running kitchens, heating, and facilities benefit from commercial solar's rapid payback and long-term savings.

**Warehousing and storage** - Cold storage facilities and distribution centres with large flat roofs generate substantial solar energy throughout the day.

## Real example: Horwich carpet shop

Horwich Interior Designs & Carpets spends £700 monthly on electricity. We designed two options:
- **Flat roof (50+ panels):** Zero bills, three-year payback
- **Flat + pitched (115 panels):** Zero bills, four-year payback

After payback, it's 20+ years of free electricity while selling excess back to the grid through Smart Export Guarantee.

## Why Bury businesses are choosing solar

Commercial electricity prices have soared - many Bury businesses face bills that have doubled or tripled. For businesses on tight margins, reducing monthly costs by 70-100% can be transformative. Solar provides immediate savings, protection from future price rises, and tangible environmental credentials increasingly valued by customers and stakeholders.

## Flat and pitched roofs

Flat roofs are brilliant for commercial solar - panels mount to point south regardless of building orientation. Pitched roofs on factories, hotels, or larger commercial buildings offer excellent potential too. We provide multiple design options with detailed financial analysis for each.

## Ground-mounted and EV charging

Spare land or grass verges work well for ground-mounted solar. We've installed systems powering [EV charging points](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) for staff vehicles - valuable employee benefit powered entirely by solar at zero ongoing cost.

## Requirements and process

You must own the building (not leased), have sufficient roof space or land, and ideally high electricity consumption for best returns. We assess your property and usage, then create detailed designs showing energy generation, cost savings, and payback period based on actual consumption patterns.
