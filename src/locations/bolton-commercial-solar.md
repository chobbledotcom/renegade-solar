# Commercial Solar for Bolton Businesses

We're currently designing a system for Horwich Interior Designs & Carpets in Bolton - they spend £700 monthly on electricity. Our 50-panel flat roof design brings that to zero with three-year payback. After that, it's decades of free electricity and income from selling excess back to the grid. If your Bolton business faces similar costs, [commercial solar](/services/commercial-solar-installations/) could transform your bottom line.

## Bolton properties perfect for commercial solar

**Retail and warehousing** - Bolton has numerous retail units, carpet shops, furniture stores, and warehouses with large flat or pitched roofs going unused. These are perfect for solar installations that generate substantial daytime energy.

**Manufacturing and factories** - Bolton's industrial heritage means many factories and manufacturing facilities with heavy machinery consumption. High electricity usage means faster payback - often 3-4 years.

**Food businesses** - Cafes, bakeries, restaurants with commercial kitchens and refrigeration see excellent returns. One local bakery spends £10,000 monthly - commercial solar could eliminate most of that cost.

**Hotels and hospitality** - Bolton's hotels and hospitality businesses running kitchens, heating, and facilities benefit from solar's rapid payback and long-term savings.

## Horwich Interior Designs & Carpets - real numbers

This family business bought their building in the 1980s and now spends £700 monthly on electricity. We designed two options:

**Option 1:** 50+ panels on the massive flat roof - brings bills to zero, three-year payback
**Option 2:** 115 panels covering both flat and pitched roofs - zero bills, four-year payback, maximum generation

Both options eliminate electricity costs and provide 20+ years of free energy after payback. They're waiting on converting the top floor to storage units before proceeding with the full installation.

## Why Bolton businesses choose solar now

Commercial electricity prices have soared - many businesses face bills that have doubled or tripled. For Bolton businesses on tight margins, reducing £700-£10,000 monthly costs to near zero can be the difference between thriving and going under. Solar provides protection from future price rises while demonstrating environmental commitment.

## Flat roofs are brilliant

Flat roofs let us mount panels pointing south regardless of building orientation. Bolton's commercial properties often have large flat roofs generating zero value - we turn those into profit centres producing decades of savings.

## Ground-mounted options

If you have spare land, grass verges, or outdoor space, ground-mounted solar supplements rooftop installations or powers [EV charging points](/services/electric-vehicle-charger-installations/) for staff vehicles. We've installed ground-mounted systems for businesses offering free staff charging powered entirely by solar.

## Requirements and coverage

You must own the building (not leased), have sufficient roof space or land, and ideally high electricity consumption for best returns. Based in nearby [Prestwich](/commercial-solar-installations-prestwich/), we serve Bolton businesses with the same local, responsive service.
