Based in nearby Prestwich, Renegade Solar provides expert EV charger installations throughout Crumpsall. As NAPIT-registered installers and an Octopus Energy Trusted Partner, we help Crumpsall residents make the switch to electric vehicles with convenient, cost-effective home charging solutions.

## Why Crumpsall Residents Need Home EV Charging

**Save thousands compared to public charging** - While there are public chargers at nearby supermarkets and shopping centres, they're expensive for regular use. Public chargers typically cost 30-60p per kWh, but home charging on Octopus Go costs just 7.5p overnight. That's up to 8 times cheaper!

**Perfect for North Manchester commutes** - Whether you're heading to Manchester city centre via the A665, commuting to Salford, or taking the M60 to Trafford Park, starting each day with a fully charged car means never hunting for public chargers. A typical Manchester commute costs under £2 with home charging versus £10+ at public chargers.

**Charge while you sleep** - Your home charger works overnight when electricity is cheapest and you don't need your car. Wake up every morning to a fully charged vehicle, ready for whatever the day brings. No more queuing at public chargers or changing your plans to find charging points.

## Crumpsall Property Types and EV Solutions

**Semi-detached houses** - Common throughout Crumpsall, these properties typically have driveways perfect for wall-mounted chargers. With 56.4% of Crumpsall's 6,020 households being single family homes, many have ideal setups for straightforward EV charger installations.

**Victorian terraces** - Older properties near the hospital and in central Crumpsall often need creative solutions. We've successfully installed chargers using rear access points, cable runs to front parking areas, and working with residents who have regular street parking spots.

**Modern developments** - Newer builds often come with driveways and modern electrical systems that easily accommodate EV charging. These properties rarely need electrical upgrades, keeping installation costs down.

**Bungalows** - Popular with older residents, these properties usually have convenient parking and accessible electrical supplies, making installations quick and straightforward.

## Smart Charging for Maximum Savings

Many Crumpsall homes already have solar panels, and we configure EV chargers to use free solar energy when available. This is perfect for retirees or home workers who can charge during sunny days.

For the majority charging overnight, smart tariffs offer massive savings:

- Daily Manchester commute (20-mile round trip): £1.50 vs £10 at public chargers
- Shopping at Tesco Cheetham Hill (8-mile round trip): 60p vs £4 public
- Weekend trips to the Peak District (80-mile round trip): £6 vs £40 public
- Visiting Liverpool (80-mile round trip): £6 vs £40 public

Annual savings for typical Crumpsall families reach £1,500-2,000 compared to public charging.

## Working with Crumpsall's Infrastructure

Crumpsall's established electrical infrastructure generally handles EV charging well. Most properties can accommodate 7kW chargers without upgrades, though some older homes might need consumer unit updates to meet current regulations - something we handle as part of our service.

With 98.7% of Crumpsall's 18,196 residents living in households rather than communal establishments, the vast majority can benefit from home charging installations.

**Terraced houses** - We've developed proven solutions for terraces, including rear-wall mounting, underground cable runs to front parking, and aesthetic cable management that doesn't detract from your property.

**Shared driveways** - For semi-detached properties with shared drives, we can install multiple chargers with appropriate cable management and load balancing.
