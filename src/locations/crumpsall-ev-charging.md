Need an EV charger in Crumpsall? I'm Ashley from Renegade Solar, based in nearby Prestwich. As a NAPIT-registered electrician and Octopus Energy Trusted Partner, I'll get your home charging sorted without the hassle.

## Cut Your Transport Costs by 85%

Public charging costs 30-60p per kWh. Home charging on Octopus Go? Just 7.5p overnight. Your daily Manchester commute drops from £10+ to under £2. That's £1,500-2,000 saved annually for typical Crumpsall families.

The [government grant](https://www.gov.uk/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grant-household) gives you up to £350 off installation. I'm OZEV-approved and handle all the paperwork.

## Crumpsall Properties Sorted

Semi-detached with a drive? Perfect for a standard wall-mounted charger. Victorian terrace near the hospital? I've installed chargers using rear access, cable runs to front parking, whatever works. Bungalow with side parking? Easy installation with minimal disruption.

"Ashley fitted an EV charger for me and provided lots of brilliant advice. His prices were the best quotes I had, with nothing reduced on the quality of his work."

## Works with Your Solar Panels

Already got solar? I'll set your charger to use free solar power during the day. One customer: "Ashley ensured our new GivEnergy charger was properly integrated with the solar and battery system."

## Local, Reliable, Honest

Being minutes away in Prestwich means no travel charges and quick response. My 9.61/10 Checkatrade rating from 80+ reviews shows I do the job right.

From Blackley: "Ashley got in touch quickly, talked it through, came and sized it up and completed the job within days. Would recommend highly."

## Stop Wasting Money

Every day you use public chargers, you're throwing money away. Home charging pays for itself quickly, then saves you thousands year after year.
