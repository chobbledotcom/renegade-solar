# EV Charger Installations in Crumpsall

Need an EV charger in Crumpsall? I'm Ashley from Renegade Solar, based in nearby Prestwich. As a NAPIT-registered electrician and Octopus Energy Trusted Partner, I'll get your home charging sorted – without the hassle.

## Cut Your Transport Costs by 85%

Public charging costs 30-60p per kWh. Home charging on Octopus Go? Just 7.5p overnight. Your daily Manchester commute drops from over £10 to under £2. That's £1,500-2,000 saved annually for typical Crumpsall families.

The [government grant](https://www.gov.uk/electric-vehicle-chargepoint-grant-household) gives you up to £350 off installation. I'm OZEV-approved and I'll handle all the paperwork.

## Crumpsall Properties Sorted

Semi-detached with a drive? Perfect for a standard wall-mounted charger. Victorian terrace near the hospital? I've installed chargers using rear access, cable runs to front parking – whatever works. Bungalow with side parking? Easy installation with minimal disruption.

## Works with Your Solar Panels

Already got solar? I'll set your charger to use free solar power during the day, so you're charging with your own clean energy.

## Local, Reliable, Honest

Being minutes away in Prestwich means no travel charges and quick response. My [9.61/10 Checkatrade rating](https://www.checkatrade.com/trades/renegadeelectrical/) from 80+ reviews shows I do the job right. I can typically get your charger installed within days of first contact – just like a recent Blackley customer who went from enquiry to installation in less than a week.

## Stop Wasting Money

Every day you use public chargers, you're throwing money away. Home charging pays for itself quickly – then it saves you thousands year after year.
