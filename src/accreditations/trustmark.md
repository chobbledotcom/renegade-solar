# TrustMark Accredited Solar Installer

TrustMark is the UK Government's only endorsed quality scheme for tradespeople working on your home, providing robust consumer protection and quality assurance.

## Why My TrustMark Accreditation Matters

When choosing Renegade Solar as your TrustMark Registered Business, you benefit from:

### Government-Backed Assurance

TrustMark approval means I've been assessed against strict government standards for technical competence, customer service and trading practices.

### Financial Protection

TrustMark businesses offer financial protection mechanisms and proper contracts, safeguarding your investment in solar technology.

### Dispute Resolution

In the unlikely event of any issues, TrustMark provides access to an independent dispute resolution service for additional peace of mind.

### Quality Workmanship

My TrustMark status confirms I follow defined quality standards specifically for renewable energy installations across North Manchester.

### Ethical Trading

TrustMark businesses commit to transparent pricing, clear communication and responsible practices throughout your solar installation project.

The TrustMark logo represents a significant advantage over non-accredited installers - it's your guarantee that your North Manchester solar installation will be completed professionally, safely and to the highest standards.
