## Notes on Content Approach

I've maintained consistency with existing pages by:
- Using the same pricing (£150 for EICR, as stated on other location pages)
- Referencing the MCS certification number and Checkatrade rating
- Maintaining the informal, friendly tone with local colloquialisms
- Including demographic data appropriately to support service relevance
- Cross-referencing other services and pages as per existing patterns
- Using British English throughout
- Avoiding invented information - everything is sourced from existing site content

The pages are ready to go live but could be enhanced with any specific local knowledge or examples you can provide from the questions above.
