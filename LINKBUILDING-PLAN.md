## Part 1: Current Online Presence (Audit)

### Where Renegade Solar currently has listings/links

| Source | URL / Status | Quality | Action Needed |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Own website** | renegade-solar.co.uk | Good — well-built, lots of local landing pages | Maintain |
| **Checkatrade** | checkatrade.com/trades/renegadeelectrical | Strong — 100 reviews, 9.86/10 | Maintain, keep requesting reviews |
| **TrustMark** | trustmark.org.uk/firms/Renegade%20Electrical%20Ltd-3127838-M24%202SY | Listed with correct details | Check link back to website is present |
| **NAPIT** | search.napit.org.uk/member/66870/renegade-electrical-ltd | Listed but no contact details shown | **Update listing** — add phone, website, email |
| **HIES Consumer Code** | search.hiesscheme.org.uk (member R302-047) | Listed | Verify link to website is present |
| **MCS Certified** | mcscertified.com/find-an-installer | Should appear in search results | Verify listing appears correctly with website link |
| **Companies House** | find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11368812 | Auto-generated, no website link | N/A — informational only |
| **Instagram** | @renegadeelectrical (221 followers, 35 posts) | Low activity | **Post more consistently**, link in bio to website |
| **LinkedIn** | linkedin.com/company/renegade-solar | Exists but sparse | **Flesh out company page** — description, services, posts |
| **Facebook** | @RenSolarManchester | Not found in search results | **Verify page exists and is public**, optimise with full details |
| **YouTube** | Channel exists (from website code) | Not found in search results | **Start posting installation videos/timelapse content** |
| **Google Business Profile** | Not confirmed in search results | **CRITICAL GAP** | **Create or claim and fully optimise** |
| **SolarReviews.com** | solarreviews.com/installers/renegade-solar-reviews | Profile exists but **zero reviews** | **Ask customers to leave reviews here** |

### Summary of current state

Renegade Solar has a solid foundation with Checkatrade, TrustMark, NAPIT, HIES, and MCS — the core accreditation bodies. But there are significant gaps in general business directories, review platforms, and social profiles. Most critically, there appears to be **no active Google Business Profile**, which is the single most impactful local SEO asset.

## Part 2: Quick Wins — Fix and Improve Existing Mentions

These are things that can be done immediately at zero cost:

### Priority 1 (Do this week)

1. **Google Business Profile** — Claim or create the listing for "Renegade Solar" at the Prestwich address. Add:
   - All services (Solar PV, Battery Storage, EV Chargers, EICR)
   - Photos of completed installations
   - Business hours
   - Link to renegade-solar.co.uk
   - Request reviews from past customers (aim for 20+ to start)

2. **NAPIT listing** — Log in and add full contact details (phone, email, website URL). Currently shows no contact information.

3. **SolarReviews.com** — The profile exists with zero reviews. Email past happy customers a direct link to leave a review. Even 5-10 reviews here would put Renegade ahead of most local competitors on this platform.

4. **LinkedIn company page** — Add a proper company description, services list, location, and start sharing installation photos/case studies. Ashley should link his personal profile as Director.

### Priority 2 (Do within a month)

5. **Facebook page** — Ensure it's publicly visible, has the correct business category (Solar Energy Company), complete contact info, website link, and regular posts.

6. **Instagram** — Increase posting frequency. Installation timelapse videos, before/after shots, and customer testimonial clips perform well. Use local hashtags (#ManchesterSolar #NorthWestSolar #PrestwichBusiness etc.)

7. **YouTube** — Start uploading installation videos, even short ones filmed on a phone. "Day in the life of a solar installer" and educational content ("How many panels does a Manchester terrace need?") can attract local traffic.

## Part 4: Competitor Gap Analysis

### What competitors do that Renegade doesn't (yet)

| Competitor | What they have | Renegade equivalent |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Solarus Energy** | Which? Trusted Trader status, 192.com listing, CHAS Elite, BREEAM, OZEV, RECC accreditations, Bark profile | Missing most of these |
| **Atlantic Renewables** | Which? Trusted Trader, CompareMySolar listing, Nextdoor page, Renewable Energy Hub listing, MyHouseProject listing | Missing all of these |
| **P4 Solar** | 219 Trustpilot reviews (5 stars), tree planting pledge (PR angle) | No Trustpilot, no PR angle |
| **Perfect Sense Energy** | Publishes "Top 10" listicle content that other sites reference | No content marketing |
| **Connect Electric (Bury)** | Which? Trusted Trader, based in nearby Whitefield | Direct local competitor — need to match their directory presence |

### Key accreditation gaps to investigate

- **Which? Trusted Trader** — Multiple competitors have this. Strong trust signal and generates a high-DA backlink.
- **RECC (Renewable Energy Consumer Code)** — Alternative to HIES, some installers hold both.
- **OZEV (Office for Zero Emission Vehicles)** — If doing EV charger installs, this accreditation generates a backlink from gov.uk-adjacent sources.
- **CHAS (Contractors Health and Safety Assessment Scheme)** — Useful for commercial work and generates a directory listing.

## Part 5: Content & PR Link Opportunities

### Guest posts / contributed content

| Target | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Feedspot's top UK solar blogs** (solarblogger.net, Naked Solar, Viridian Solar, Project Solar UK) | Pitch practical guest posts: "What Manchester homeowners need to know about solar on terraced houses", "Battery storage in the North West — is it worth it?" |
| **MoneySavingExpert forums** | Become an active, helpful contributor in solar threads. Don't spam — answer questions honestly and mention Renegade naturally when relevant. |
| **Manchester-focused blogs and news** | Pitch to local outlets: Manchester Evening News, About Manchester, Confidentials, I Love MCR. Angle: local business story, energy cost savings, green Manchester. |
| **Loom Solar "Write for Us"** | Submit a guest post (they accept solar industry content and allow backlinks) |

### Case study / PR angles

| Angle | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **"Local sparky turned solar entrepreneur"** | Ashley's personal story — 15+ years as an electrician, worked on Terminal 2, now helping Manchester go green. Human interest piece for local press. |
| **Customer case studies** | Publish detailed case studies on the website (with real kWh data, bill savings, photos). These become linkable assets that directories, blogs, and forums can reference. |
| **School/community projects** | If Renegade has done or could do a school or community building, pitch it to GM Green City and local press. |
| **"Manchester terrace solar" niche** | Create the definitive guide to solar panels on Manchester terraces — roof angles, sizes, planning, shading from neighbours. This is genuinely useful content that could attract natural links. |

### Local link building

| Source | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Prestwich & Whitefield business groups** | Join local business networks (Prestwich Village Community, Bury Business Club, etc.) — these often have member directories online |
| **Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce** | Membership includes a directory listing with backlink |
| **Federation of Small Businesses (FSB)** | Member directory with backlink |
| **Supplier partnerships** | DMEGC, Trina, Solax, AlphaESS — ask to be listed as an approved installer on their UK websites |
| **Octopus Energy partner page** | Already a Trusted Partner — verify there's a link from Octopus's website to Renegade |

## Part 7: Tracking

Keep a simple spreadsheet tracking:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Directory/site name |
| **URL** | Link to our listing |
| **Status** | Applied / Listed / Rejected |
| **Link type** | Dofollow / Nofollow / Unlinked mention |
| **DA (approx)** | Domain authority of linking site |
| **Date submitted** | When we applied |
| **Date live** | When the link went live |
| **Notes** | Login details, contact person, renewal dates |

---

## Notes

- This plan focuses on realistic, achievable link building for a small local business. We're not competing with national brands for high-DA editorial links — we're building a comprehensive, consistent local link profile that search engines trust.
- The most impactful single action is getting a properly optimised Google Business Profile with reviews. This alone will improve local search visibility significantly.
- Quality over quantity. A link from Which? Trusted Traders or Green Economy is worth more than 50 spam directory submissions.
- Every listing should use consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) details across all platforms. Inconsistency confuses search engines.
- Review velocity matters. A steady flow of 2-3 new reviews per month across Google, Checkatrade, and Trustpilot is more valuable than a one-off burst.
